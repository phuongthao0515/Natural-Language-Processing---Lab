Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on.

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen.

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \n\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."}]}

This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."},{"_id":"8363944","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1382932800000"}},"listing_id":"1001265","reviewer_id":"7096845","reviewer_name":"Jean","comments":"Fantastic location!

It's definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option.

The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"11063672","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1395115200000"}},"listing_id":"1001265","reviewer_id":"12932701","reviewer_name":"Tami","comments":"If you are looking for a home base with the basics to lay your head at night and have breakfast in and then head out for the day this fits the bill.

There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn't be for you. The dependability of the elevators, particularly during high winds, is a bit of a concern.\r\n\r\nI never met David, things were handled via airbnb email.

As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.  This was my very first experience ever using Airbnb so I didn't really know what to expect.  I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.

The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world’s top fashion houses—Tiffany & Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod’s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you're headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge. During busy times you may have to wait for the elevator, only 1 is working, but there are stairs."},{"_id":"242428030","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1520744400000"}},"listing_id":"1001265","reviewer_id":"168734883","reviewer_name":"Chang Kong","comments":"We were a little disappointed with the overall stay.  The place was not thoroughly cleaned. Everything was dusty or had not wiped down/ cleaned. Appliances were dirty so we did not use them and the sponge in the kitchen had hairs stuck on it. There was also hair on the floor and restroom. I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they needed to do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren’t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on. Although we were aware of the elevator issues, the wait for the elevator took up to 15 mins at times.\n\nWas located in a very nice location, close to everything. You could walk everywhere. The host was very nice and contacted us before arrival and before leaving.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a comfortable stay, I would suggest going to a hotel."},{"_id":"244565441","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1521345600000"}},"listing_id":"1001265","reviewer_id":"172450613","reviewer_name":"Amanda","comments":"This is a great little apartment.

David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.

Here are my reasons:\r\nFirst - she as a person made me feel super welcome. I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.

They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks.

Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area.

Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!"},{"_id":"236131644","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1518930000000"}},"listing_id":"10057826","reviewer_id":"11623469","reviewer_name":"Adam","comments":"we rented the suite at the henry norman hotel, and it was lovely"}]}

The unit is an easy 5-minute walk from the Trindade Metro Station. There were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and two supermarkets within 5-minutes of walking (one was open on Sundays, which saved our lives). Though the apartment is located in a lively area, an extra set of shutters provides an additional layer of sound insulation which was a big plus! \r\nCons: The apartment did not have shampoo/conditioner during our stay. Neighbors could be loud at times. Very little sound insulation on the apartment unit door.\r\nOverall: My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fabio's apartment building.

It is so close that I could go there on foot, and that is why I chose it. However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\n\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\n\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\n\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \n\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend."},{"_id":"181577731","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1502596800000"}},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"31316205","reviewer_name":"Ayça","comments":"Vicky was very helpful and provided any assistance I needed.

The apartment is very quiet for the area. Although I never met Yi in person she was always accessible to communicate. The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\n\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments. There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\n\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\n\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\n\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas."},{"_id":"400087952","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1547182800000"}},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"233481626","reviewer_name":"Li","comments":"地理位置方便,房东耐心,人美心善!"},{"_id":"402007119","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1547701200000"}},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"38063545","reviewer_name":"Andy","comments":"."},{"_id":"402572546","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1547874000000"}},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"234227205","reviewer_name":"Jason","comments":"很棒的一次體驗"},{"_id":"403896707","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1548133200000"}},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"6469979","reviewer_name":"William","comments":"this is a cool little place - has a lounge - and kitchen! would definitely go back here for sure!"},{"_id":"406308919","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1548738000000"}},"listing_id":"10084023","reviewer_id":"6259521","reviewer_name":"Rhianwen","comments":"This is a good, affordable place to stay while exploring Hong Kong for a few days, especially if you're going to be out and about a lot.

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \nAwful experience all around."},{"_id":"204383727","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1508212800000"}},"listing_id":"10091713","reviewer_id":"155042249","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival.

On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."},{"_id":"238803427","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1519707600000"}},"listing_id":"10091713","reviewer_id":"13988353","reviewer_name":"Selina","comments":"We travelled with a 4 month old baby.

For once the pictures really don't do it justice.  The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."},{"_id":"139320556","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1490328000000"}},"listing_id":"10108388","reviewer_id":"3774958","reviewer_name":"Ishara","comments":"Desireé’s apartment is the perfect place to explore Sydney city from. Perfectly central to all city sights. The apartment was super clean and neat. It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host.

The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\r\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\r\n\r\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before.

Abbiamo avuto una pessima esperienza. Mia moglie, io e i tre bambini non abbiamo potuto fermarci neanche un minuto per le pessime condizioni in cui abbiamo trovato l'appartamento. Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."}]}

Gott sei dank war mein Flug pünktlich und die Einreise verlief ohne Verzögerung, also konnte ich schon um 10pm in mein zimmer. Durch den Flug war ich sehr erschöpft und ging nach einer kurzen Dusche gleich ins Bett. Das Zimmer ist geräumig und mit einem großen Bett und einem Ventilator ausgestattet. Der war auch dringend notwendig, da es in New York im Juli sehr heiß ist. Lane war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Da ich aber am nächsten Tag schon um 5 am aus dem Haus bin, kann ich recht viel mehr auch nicht sagen. Die Nacht war ruhig und angenehm.

During our stay we didn't have much Interaktion with Lane and Annette though,  since we were gone exploring the city most of the time. The room was fine and just like depicted, but, as mentioned in previous comments, quite hot. The subway was only a short walk away, however, if there were constructions or delays, it sometimes took us over an hour to get into Manhatten - so just be aware of that. If you are planning to cook while in New York, I wouldn't necessarily recommend their place as the kitchen was rather poorly equipped and the cupboards above the stove were pretty greasy. Altogether: if you are just staying for a couple of nights and don't expect to be right at the edge of Manhatten, it's a good place to stay at.

Althought there was a slight effort of communication between us and Anette, I didn't really feel that welcomed like with our previous hosts, which might have made me look little bit uneasy. There was also very big traffic around the single bathroom which took away little bit of our privacy. In any case the apartament title is not misleading.

I was actually out and about pretty much the whole time from the moment I landed so I only dealt with Anette, but she was super friendly and pleasant. They keep their place clean and presentable so be sure to take your shoes off at the door! Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops. However, if you'd prefer to cook, they do have a kitchen, which I did not take advantage of. Again, I was out and about pretty much the whole time, but Lane's place is an excellent place if you need a clean bed and shower. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken I saw a Keurig, which I also did not take advantage of, but if you need some caffeine to start your day, then boom!"},{"_id":"218267130","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1512968400000"}},"listing_id":"10140368","reviewer_id":"103900814","reviewer_name":"Javeria","comments":"Very pleasant lady and very clean space"},{"_id":"218579136","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1513141200000"}},"listing_id":"10140368","reviewer_id":"124988427","reviewer_name":"Andreea","comments":"A warm, inviting home.

The exact apartment is a bit hard to find so I recommend communications with Lane as the date of the stay gets closer so that she can help you find her place and coordinate your check-in.

Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)"},{"_id":"36828326","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1435723200000"}},"listing_id":"1016739","reviewer_id":"36481755","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"David introduced himself almost immediately on arrival and made me feel welcome.

Luckily, I have more space. \r\n\r\nThe room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"79349243","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1465704000000"}},"listing_id":"1019168","reviewer_id":"50080424","reviewer_name":"Matt","comments":"Laura was a brilliant host.

There's no way you could be bored having her around. \nIf you're only visiting for a few days, she will definitely be a good adviser, she knows her city by heart.

Meno di 10 minuti a piedi e si raggiunge la stazione della metropolitana Laurier e in meno di 15 minuti quella di Mont-Royal. Inoltre l'autobus 55 passa a un minuto a piedi da casa e ti porta in Downtown - old port in 20 minuti e in little italy in 15. Il quartiere è pieno di cafè, gallerie d'arte, negozi vintage e bistro dove cenare o fare un brunch! E' davvero un luogo autentico.\nLilou è un host fantastica.. e la sua gatta Milton è molto dolce e simpatica.\nLa casa ha tutto ciò che (Website hidden by Airbnb) cucina è ben fornita e in taverna c'è la lavatrice e l'asciugatrice che si può utilizzare liberamente."},{"_id":"264348567","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1526184000000"}},"listing_id":"1019168","reviewer_id":"719179","reviewer_name":"Erik","comments":"The location of Lilou's place in the heart of the Plateau couldn't be better: really good restaurants just a block away (try Robin Du Bois!), a superb massage and bodywork business just around the corner (Place Nomade), a few blocks to the supermarket in one direction, a few more blocks to the natural food store in another direction, great ethnic restaurants in every direction, even an excellent hardware store in walking distance, not to mention big public parks (especially Mont Royal), about a 15-minute walk to the Laurier metro stop, Portuguese, Greek and Hassidic communities nearby, trendy bars, vintage bagel shops...etc., etc. A very fun area to be in. To stay in this airbnb, you definitely need to be OK with cats, since the very friendly black cat who lives there considers herself the true owner.

Super hip neighborhood, a beautiful park not too far away and so many lovely shops/cafes, if that’s what you’re into. There was a grocery store across the street and lots of bus stops nearby. The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It’s ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn’t make my stay any less incredible.

It was so convenient to borrow the bikes and ride to the rock pool or any of the beaches along the coast. Tracy’s place is a gem. We will definitely come back some time."},{"_id":"348199484","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1541998800000"}},"listing_id":"10213499","reviewer_id":"27428077","reviewer_name":"Lara","comments":"Such a fabulous spot!

He was very responsive to our communication and helpful in providing direction once our flight landed.  He even provided us with the written directions in Cantonese in case our taxi driver didn’t speak English (which came in very handy!).\r\n\r\nRicky had his cousin meet us at a College which was 10 minutes from the airport.  His cousin was very friendly and helpful – he even arrived with a cart to carry our bags to the apartment.   As there are no vehicles that directly access Ricky’s neighbourhood, there was a lovely 5 minute walk on a beautiful path which weaved through the jungle.  \r\n\r\nUpon arrival at Ricky’s building, it was clear that the place was very clean and well kept.  He provided us with some water bottles, offered us dinner, and his 2 friendly cats entertained us while he checked us in.  He proceeded to show us the rooftop terrace which is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view of the mountains.  There is also an area to wash and hang dry your laundry up there.\r\n\r\nThe room appeared to be recently renovated.  It was small, but it was very clean and efficiently laid out.  There was good A/C to keep cool as well as a TV with some basic cable for some entertainment.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a perfect place nearby the airport to spend the night before continuing our travels.

Furthermore, they gave us a walking tour around the property as well as highlighted all the main attractions in and around their area. \n\nI would also recommend this property to anyone who is interested in going to Hong Kong Disneyland as it has a close proximity to the Metro Station and local bus routes. \n\nAll in all, Ricky and his friend were very friendly, professional, and informative.

Our flight arrived at 11:45pm and left the next day at 10:15am. Ricky was great about communicating with me from beginning to end. He answered all my questions super fast! Even though I had a somewhat late arrival, his cousin Terry met us and had a dolly for our luggage. His place is like this hidden oasis. You take this cool walk through all these fruit trees. It looks like a forest! It's off the beaten path, but that's what adds to it's charm and appeal. When you get to his place, it's quiet and you feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle, but you're really not. \n\nThe room that we stayed in had a separate entrance from the house, so it was like we had our own apartment,  minus the kitchen. My boyfriend and I each had a backpack and a carry on suitcase. The room was a bit tight for us and our stuff, but it was manageable. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. It had all the amenities you would need...towels, soap, shampoo, comfy and clean bed, heat or AC (which we didn't use), safe place, and privacy. The room was just what we needed. We had our own bed and restroom. It was clean and it was close to the airport. Plus, there's wifi! Since I arrived kind of late, I texted Ricky about the wifi and he got back to me right away! \n\nThen, on our departure day, Terry had arranged a taxi for us and saw us off. It was like VIP service without the VIP price.  Overall, you can't go wrong by booking with Ricky and Terry. These guys know what they're doing. Their place is just what you need...if it's for one night or more...you'll get great hosts with a great place to stay. Don't wait...just book with them!

It is everything their ad says and more. It really is about as far removed from the Honolulu tourist bustle as one can get. This is a huge bonus to experience Hawaii and a place to live and enjoy the people and untouched beaches along the Waianae Coast.  The Waianae Harbor is just down the road and is where many people from the Waikiki hotels get bused an hour to board the boats to go out for turtle and dolphin cruises.  But, you will be right there! The condo tower community is much more resort like than other condos (minus a restaurant on property), but with the many local restaurants nearby you will never get bored with the eating out options. The condo in modern with all the essential elements. The bathroom is large, the bed is comfy. This is one of the rare units with a screen front door so you can open it up to enjoy a cross breeze if desired and not get attacked by mosquitoes. The view is fantastic. Laundry is just down the hall. I highly recommend Ray and Lise's place!\n\nA word about Handicap Access: If you are handicap and need to avoid stairs, be sure to bring your handicap placard from your car so they give you a special pass to park in the resident parking. I have a bum knee so stairs are not my friend. The standard visitor parking in on the lowest level and is a bit of a hike and many stairs which is no issue for most travelers. There are no handicap parking stalls; all are on a first come basis so if you get back late at night, parking can be a challenge, but you can still avoid stairs by walking in a different door/elevator and making your way to the condo. The pool is three flights of stairs down; no elevator options. But, if you drive your car around to the pool there is a ramp up to the BBQ area to eliminate most of the stairs but you will still have about 10 steps up yo the pool to deal with. Unfortunately there is no wheelchair access to the pool.

Ray and Lise’s condo is an excellent choice for travellers who are not afraid to get away from the tourist hotspots and are willing and able to drive back and forth to the sights that you want to see.  The beaches on this side of the island are unreal! You have to see them to believe them.  Specifically Ray and Lise’s condo is very comfortable, with all amenities and a comfy bed.  We spent a lot of our days either touring the island or at the beach so we were very glad to have a comfy condo with Cable Tv to come home to in the evening.  \nThe views are spectacular!  The kitchen is well appointed and we cooked almost all our meals at the condo, or down at the bbq area. The pool area is very well kept, clean and quiet.  The grounds on the property are very pretty.  We experienced no noise issues while we were there.  The staff at this facility are very very friendly and we had no issues with checking in and getting around the property.  \nRay and Lise have beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas, snorkelling gear and books for their guests to use as needed. This was very helpful for us when we spent time at the beaches!\nRay and Lise’s communication throughout the booking process and leading up to the trip was impeccable. They answered all questions i had and were very quick to offer advise for our stay.

Andreia führte uns bei der Begrüßung nach oben und zeigte uns die Räumlichkeiten, welche den Eindruck bestätigen, der durch die Fotos entstanden ist: Für einen Kurztrip, wo ihr die meiste Zeit des Tages außerhalb verbringt. In der Parallelstraße überhalb der Rua das Flores befindet sich ein Supermarkt an dem wir uns mit dem nötigsten an Verpflegung für unseren Aufenthalt ausstatten konnten. Darüber hinaus gab uns Andreia viele Tipps zur Freizeitgestaltung in Porto. Sämtliche Anziehungspunkte sind aufgrund der zentralen Lage super einfach und in der Regel innerhalb von 10 - 15 Minuten Fußmarsch zu erreichen. An der angrenzenden Station Sao Bento fährt auch die Buslinie 500, welche euch in ca. 40 Minuten zum Stadtstrand in Matosinhos bringt. Wir haben die vier Tage in Porto sehr genossen und netterweise kümmerte sich Andreia am letzten Tag sogar noch darum, dass wir unser Gepäck nach dem Checkout sicher für ein paar Stunden verstauen konnten.

And the fact that it was a 5 minute drive from Volcano park was the icing on the cake. Mike is a real gentleman, informative, kind, and easy to contact. We will not forget the cherished experience he afforded. \n\n\nWe particularly enjoyed the cabin's  rare blend of rustic charm and meticulously maintained, modern elegance. The beautiful wood interior with exposed beams, light scent of cedar, old-fashioned fireplace, and free-standing antique tub, all made the cabin incredibly charming. The wrap-around porch was not only scenic, but very quiet and mosquito free. It was a wonderful place to chat in the evenings, read selections from the bookshelf, and to enjoy the delicious breakfast items provided, including fresh papaya. Since the cabin resides at the end of the residential area, the only thing visible for miles from the back porch was lush, pristine forest. The cabin's enveloping sense of privacy was relaxing and romantic. \n\nWith respect to the cabin's modern appeal, where does one begin? Even the toaster lowered the bread automatically. One can enjoy coffee prepared by three different methods, including French press, and Mike made sure we had ample amounts of freshly ground coffee. The stainless steel fridge was packed with complementary goodies as well. Being expert snackers, we were quite pleased. \n\nThis understood, the modern conveniences went far beyond food. We enjoyed being able to dim the lights just the right amount in each room to create the desired ambiance. The king-sized bed in the loft was incredibly comfortable and featured three types of pillows, including a memory foam option. But the aspect of our stay we liked the most had to do with the modern architecture of the cabin itself. The walls of the A-frame design, both behind the bed and in front of it, feature large windows with breathtaking views of the forest. As a result, the typical distinction between interior and exterior does not apply. The effect was magical. Waking up in the morning, we were in awe. \n\nThanks again for everything, Mike.

This house was modern with beautiful furniture, gorgeous floors, and beautiful bathtub/sinks/counters. There are so many windows. There is an L-shaped wrap around deck that is massive. We spent almost all of our time sitting out there on the comfortable patio furniture, listening to the jungle, drinking our freshly prepared 100% Hawaiin coffee that our host provided. (Also, we didnt get a single mosquito bite. We never even saw any.) \n\nSpeaking of what the host provided for us: coffee, tea, oats, pancake mix, butter, sugar, syrup, fresh jam, eggs, orange juice, milk, chocolate, yogurt, and fruit.

Die Lage, die Ausstattung, die Sauberkeit, bequemes Bett, alles hat gestimmt. \nMike ist sehr fürsorglich und er hat die Cabin liebevoll eingerichtet. Man spürt, dass es ihm wichtig ist, dass die Gäste sich wohl fühlen (mehrere Blumengestecke, kuscheliger Morgenmantel)). Er hat zur Benützung ausführliche Instruktionen gegeben (Papaya zum Frühstück schon vorbereitet) und war bei Fragen  erreichbar.  \nPreislich ist die Cabin eher im oberen Segment, aber für eine kleine Ferien-Hütte am Rand vom Naturschutztreservat mit Blick auf den wilden Urwald mit all seinen Annehmlichkeiten eigentlich unbezahlbar.\nEs kann bisweilen ziemlich kühl sein auf 1000 Fuss (?m), gegen Mittag fängt es auch häufig zu nieseln / regnen an. Hatte häufig meine Daunenjacke an, Heizungslüfter wäre bei Bedarf vorhanden. Ich habe 2 Nächte gebucht. Mit allem was es im Vulkanpark zu sehen gibt,  könnte man durchaus auch noch länger da verweilen. \n\nZusätzlich ist Mike als erfahrener \"Seebär\" (eigenes Schiff) darauf bedacht, dass auch Kleinigkeiten stimmen, die einem das Leben erleichtern ( hawaianische Musik ab MP3 Player, grosse Bibliothek über Hawaii ( Pflanzen, Tiere, Geschichtevetc etc). Er hat zudem ein grosses Wissen über einheimische Pflanzen und Tiere, die er einem gerne weitergibt.\nEr geht praktisch jeden Morgen zum Vulkan. Er hat mich spontan um 05 30 frühmorgends zum \"glow\"  mitgenommen (leuchten der Magma, am besten b Sonnen auf oder -Untergang sichtbar). Danach haben wir in der Militär- basis im Park gefrühstückt und über \"Gott ind die Welt\" gesprochen. \nThanks for all that, dear Mike. I appreciated my stay a lot.

Mike provided a warm in-person greeting despite our late night arrival, and had just about everything ready that you could imagine. The fridge was well stocked with juice, jams, eggs, fruit, and a few other tasty treats ready for us to consume. He gave us a quick tour around, made sure we had an answer to all our questions, and even had two wonderfully fuzzy robes ready for us.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know what to do in Volcano, don't worry! Mike has great recommendations of what to do anywhere on the island, and gave us great ideas for where to go inside the park and around volcano as well.\r\n\r\nIf this hasn't convinced you already, I'm not sure what will.

This gave us enough time to explore VNP, drive to Kalapana and bike to the lava flow, and to just relax and enjoy the cabin. \n\nThe location is perfect. It's less than 10 minutes from the entrance of the park and we found ourselves going early in the morning to beat the crowd and after dark to see the volcano glow from the Jagger Museum. The cabin is completely secluded but only a short drive from the highway. Just over the highway there are several restaurants and convenience stores. We really enjoyed dinner at the Kilauea Lodge. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful and charming. Mike has thought of absolutely everything and was very attentive to any needs we had. We could see the sunrise from our bed and on a clear night we could see the moon and stars. The cabin can be chilly at night and the area can get cold and rainy, so pack accordingly.

There are so many things to say here, but I'll just focus on the two most important and overarching areas of interest: the host and the home. The most accurate description I can relinquish of this host (Mike) is that he was kind, organized, informed, and impressively meticulous in his attention to detail. We actually ran into him by coincidence while out hiking the VNP trails and we were glad to share in part of a hike with him to have the chance to get to know him better. Our brief Mike-guided tour was just a nice bonus as he is an admirable conversationalist with an interesting life and is very knowledgeable of the VNP area. We have personally ranked him as our overall best host in all of our AirBnB stays to date, and that is saying a lot as we have been very fortunate to have nearly all positive experiences via AirBnB. Albeit, Mike sets the bar really high; the previous makes sense given he basically lives in the clouds in the shadow of a volcano. The home was incredible and in retrospect remains our favorite place we stayed this year on the islands of Hawaii and Maui (out of 7 other homes and/or hotels). Mike has obviously placed a lot of consideration into this offering and continues to build upon a rock solid foundation of thoughtful hosting. He easily supplies every utensil, comfort, amenity, and convenience you could expect and/or want in this upscaled cabin. There are all the expected and unexpected kitchen fixings, a small library in a large wall-shelf filled with Hawaii-centric materials, several dehumidifiers, music and lighting that just delivers a very creature-comfort cabin experience, and a slew of other add-ons provided to make life just a little easier on your trip. The interior of this house has so many fine things it's hard to list but our personal favorites were the 100-year old clawfoot tub (also functions as a standing shower), the tempur-pedic bed and ultra comfortable bedding, and last but not least the carefully selected combinations of wood all throughout the house, which make it feel like it's both somewhere old and somewhere new to its guest as well as blends the home into its earthy and forested setting just outside the glass doors. The lanai wraps around the unit and makes for an amazingly tranquil place to eat a meal or listen and watch the rain. The surrounding area is residential but spread out and Mike's place seems like it's in own little universe, tucked between the trees. We found the flying cloud was easy to find (via GPS) and an absolutely perfect spot for those looking to enjoy the VNP as its very close (<10mins) and makes for a seems-to-good-to-be-true home base. There are plenty of other things I could continue on to say in..."},{"_id":"122743156","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1482642000000"}},"listing_id":"10280433","reviewer_id":"6068562","reviewer_name":"Srihari","comments":"The best bnb experience we ever had - Mike's warm hospitality, the sound and view of the rainforest surrounding the cabin, the cabin itself (well designed, open, clean and well stocked), and the proximity to the National park.\n\nMike is a very friendly and warm person. His eye for detail, organized manner, and thoughtfulness comes across in so many tiny details in the cabin that will make your stay that much more comfortable. The same can be said of his communication and cabin's (Website hidden by Airbnb) was very kind of him in getting us warm pumpkin bread and papaya on the second day of our stay - which were so tasty. He also gave us helpful suggestions/information on places/hikes to visit/do and best timings for them. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful with its big lanai overlooking the rainforest, and big windows bringing the outside in being the highlights for us. We enjoyed sitting out and hearing the sounds of the rainforest and the wind in the pitch dark night, sleeping to the melodious pattering of the rain on the roof, and waking up to the view of the rainforest outside your bedroom windows. The cabin has a well equipped and well stocked kitchen, which was very helpful for us as we cooked our meals. The rest of the cabin was very comfortable as well.\n\nThank you Mike.

Mike was an amazing host. He met us at the cabin when we arrived, told us about the area as well as anything we could possibly need to know about the cabin. He also had a stocked fridge with essentials, interesting books on the volcano, and about five different ways to make coffee. On top of that, he gave us great advice about hikes and how best to enjoy the volcano. \n\nThe cabin itself is truly amazing. The great pictures don't even do it justice. He clearly puts so much thought and care into every detail. \n\nThe location is perfect for seeing the volcano (an easy five minute drive to the park entrance). \n\nThis will be one of the best AirBnbs you will ever stay at.

The tree ferns off the back porch beckon to the 25000 acres of tropical rainforest beyond. Bask in the light of the full moon coming through the 'front window' as you sleep in the king-sized loft bed. The host does a wonderful introduction to 'Flying Cloud' which includes the on site iPad with links to the popular attractions of the area. To the science buffs out there, prepare to be delighted. Are you a sailor perhaps? The host will regale you with tales. Two days is barely enough time to experience the area.\nI could not recommend this place more highly. A marvelous piece of tropical high-altitude 'wet coast' Hawaiian paradise awaits the visitor to 'Ao Lele Flying Cloud'.

It is so close to Volcano National Park but still feels very secluded, like you are in the middle of the rainforest (which you are!). It is even more beautiful than the pictures and I cannot recommend it highly enough. \n\nMike is the definition of above and beyond. From waiting in the driveway with an umbrella to carry our bags and protect us from the rain upon our arrival to dropping off freshly baked pumpkin bread one morning, he thinks of everything and is a very kind and considerate person. This was by far the most thorough check-in I've ever had on AirBnB, as he walked us through every detail of the cottage that we would need to know, including the many different approaches to coffee-making that were available! I'm sure he would have been happy to help if we had any questions, but he was so thorough in explanations of not only the cottage but also the national park and the Volcano community that we never had any. He obviously loves this cottage very much and you will too. \n\nMy only tip is that it does get cool in the mornings and evenings. Mike warned us about this and provided firewood, a space heater and fluffy robes so it's not a problem, but my tip is to make bring some warm lounge-wear to make the mornings and evenings even cosier, which not everybody would think about planning a trip to Hawaii.

My husband fell almost immediately upon entering it --the tub is simply unsafe.  As a result, we did not stay and found accommodations elsewhere.  The home appeared clean but the host was clearly obsessed and spent a full hour telling us the do's & don'ts, while our dinners got cold and we were shivering on the porch... Ex: don't cook steak (no ventilation), don't leave the bathroom door open (humidity issue), don't wear shoes in the house, don't bring your suitcases upstairs to the bedroom, don't be concerned that the bedroom has no curtains, don't use the lights or the space heater too much because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, don't be alarmed to see the host working in the yard during our stay, and don't be alarmed if the host comes into the house while we're gone to get his yard tools, and on and on for an hour.  The whole experience was bizarre and uncomfortable.  The host wouldn't leave until we told him we had heard enough, that it was very late, that our dinners were now cold and so were we, and our groceries were sitting on the counter unpacked.  About an hour after the host finally left, my husband attempted to bathe and fell in the tub.  He could barely get out of the tub without falling again.  In all our stays in private homes and hotels, we have never previously experienced a tub so slippery.  While we were willing to overlook the host's bizarre behavior and rules, the unsafe tub was unacceptable.

We missed viewing the first night because we hit some fog but were able to return the following night to an intensely beautiful milky way/night sky contrasted with the glorious glow of Kilauea. Although Volcano is remote, it is a great set up to check out the green and black sand beaches. Mike is so thoughtful and aware of some of the limitations of the small town, he provided a wonderful little spread so that we might enjoy home-cooked breakfast and teas. He also has an extensive coffee setup for coffee folks as well. We slept very well and there are extra touches like comfortable bedding and thick towels that show Mike's put a lot of thought into folks' stays. It does get chilly in volcano but he's got that covered too; there is rain gear, a little stove that can be lit and small space heater if the temps dip. Do bring layers if you can particularly if it's winter since elevation is >4K feet. Would've stayed longer if we could, don't miss Mike's place!"},{"_id":"228664631","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1516424400000"}},"listing_id":"10280433","reviewer_id":"18780952","reviewer_name":"Niko","comments":"If you're thinking about staying at Mike's place, honestly, just look no further and book now before someone else does!\n\nMike's place is unbelievably beautiful. The backyard is literally 20,000 acres of untouched forest. It is incredibly private and secluded, yet is only a 5 minute drive to get dinner/food. For a \"rustic\" style place, it is absolutely modern and very clean.\n\nMike takes care of the place so well. Everything is in perfect functioning condition and he obviously cares a lot about the place and your stay in it.\n\nLastly, Mike has an impeccable attention to detail. He even lit a fire in the wood burning stove because he knew we were coming and it was raining out. The bed and pillows were so comfortable; everything is beautifully matching (e.g. the soap dispenser, toilet flusher, and TP holder are all bronze brushed steel -- he has a knack for design); everything is premium and high quality! By the way, if you're a coffee hound like I am, he has an Aeropress for your use!\n\nWe didn't expect it, but staying at Mike's place was one of the highlights of our trip. It will be for you too, trust me!"},{"_id":"229310639","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1516597200000"}},"listing_id":"10280433","reviewer_id":"114406459","reviewer_name":"J.

This absurdly clean cabin is set in a beautiful fern forest very close to the entrance to the volcano park, and although it rained during our entire stay we still had an amazing time cozying up here. Mike was super helpful, even built us a fire while we were out most days we stayed. Other good things:\n- Very comfy bed\n- Cleanest airbnb I've ever stayed in: you can tell Mike really cares for this place\n- Great kitchen amenities, if your style is to stay in and cook like ours\n- Fresh/delicious breakfast spread, which Mike restocked during our stay\n- Location: great if you're more into lush jungle vibe rather than beachy resort. Even though it was cloudy/rainy most of the time we were there in mid-February, we were so close to the park that the instant the weather cleared we were able to go see \"the glow\" of Halemaumau: the fog can descend in an instant during the winter (as it did for us) and you have to be close by to catch a good glimpse!\n\nThanks again for a wonderful cozy cabin stay."},{"_id":"238759635","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1519621200000"}},"listing_id":"10280433","reviewer_id":"168984078","reviewer_name":"Kevin","comments":"This was our first Airbnb experience and it didn't disappoint.

You found it. Perfect if you want to be off the grid , hidden and left to your own imagination. There is adequate wi-fi when you need it. I travel for a living so the last thing I want on vaca is a stale hotel room. Flying cloud is a very private and cozy retreat. We picked this place out of many others that were available in the area because we wanted a nature infused seclusion. We have a 5 yr old daughter left back home with grandma and this was exactly what we needed. Easy access to Hilo , Volcano and other points of interest on the island. I proposed to my long time (15yr) side kick during a day trip to the southern most point of US. I’ve been to 42 of the 50 states now and i have to say the big island is one of the most beautiful scenic places I have ever experienced. Stay here you won’t be disappointed.

The apartment was spacious enough for us (a family of four) and the location was amazing.  You are steps to Central Park and to the 86th subway.  There are wonderful restaurants and shopping nearby if you need that but the small kitchen is fine for quick snacks and breakfast.  It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!

We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).

The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away.

Located close to Central Park, and many restaurants just a few blocks over.  Very happy to be so close to the subway which made going downtown very easy. \n\nWe were a couple and extra adult, who slept in the loft. It is a loft (can't stand up) but nice to sleep on a real mattress,  as opposed to fold out sofas like much of the value for money accommodation in New York. \n\nChas was easy to communicate with, and very accommodating as we were able to arrange for us to drop our bags off early before check in so that we could head off and explore. Would stay again in the future, as such great value for money (and doesn't feel like your staying a shoe box, like most of NYC). Would be perfect for families. Thanks!

Loved the location. Subway one block away. You can see Central Park when you walk out the front door. Riverside park is just a few blocks in the other direction. \nUWS is a great place to stay in the city. I've stayed in UES and Harlem before. UWS and UES is about the same, but this location at UWS is quieter. \n\nFor great restaurants just walk on over to Columbus Av, Amsterdam Av or Broadway and your set. \n\nThe apartment: It was nice, big and homely. The bushes by the little veranda could use some trimming but we didn't have time to use it anyway. \nAC is really good. You leave it off when you go out. Put it on when you get back in and it's nice, and cool in minutes. \nAs indicated, the ceiling in the loft is low. You can't stand up straight. But there's plenty of room up there. \n\nCommunicating with Chas was easy. He always answered my questions quickly. \n\nOverall a great experience!

Wifi was excellent and a decent sized TV with Netflix which we didn't use once because there were more exciting things to do.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the apartment block is very quiet ... amazing given how close it is to the main road of restaurants, shops and bars of Bedford Avenue.  \r\n\r\nWe walked around day and night in perfectly safe environment.  We took Ade up on some recommended places to eat and they were all great local places, well researched.\r\n\r\nIt was easy walking distance to all points of interest in Williamsburg, from the vintage market to the regular street food festival and East River Ferry, providing access to other parts of Brooklyn, downtown NYC and Governor's Island.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAde welcomed in and helped us up with the bags on day 1.  There is no lift but compared to subways, a few flights of stairs was not a problem.  Again, on departure day she was very accommodating letting us leave the bags and helping us with getting them down again."},{"_id":"14937315","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1404014400000"}},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"12438032","reviewer_name":"Anne","comments":"Ade's place was terrific.

It's clean and well decorated, quite roomy (at least compared to NYC hotels), and very convenient. It has a clean, nice shower, a comfortable bed, a roomy sitting area and a writing desk. It also has a small, very practical kitchen that you can use to cook meals when not eating out. There's a medium size flat screen TV in the bedroom, with Netflix, and the internet wifi connection, which is immensely important to me as a tech guy on the go, was lightning fast.\r\n\r\nThe building is a little old and unkept, but don't let that scare you - the apartment is in perfect condition. Do be aware that it's on the 4th floor and the stairwell is quite steep, so don't stay here if you have a disability or very small children.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful thing about the apartment is the neighbourhood. Williamsburg is charming, and there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants literally a few steps away. I particularly liked \"Samurai Mama\" and \"Snacky\", check them out if you're into Asian food. There's also the Williamsburg Music Hall and the Knitting Factory - well known venues where you can sample the local rock bands. And, importantly, the streets felt to me safe enough to walk around alone at night.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is a few minutes away from the subway station where you can take the L train to Manhattan - a few stations away.\r\n\r\nAde herself was friendly and very helpful. I found her to be the perfect host - responsive enough when I needed her, but she didn't bother me at all when I didn't.\r\n\r\nI travel to NYC a lot, and I will be more than happy to stay at Ade's again next time I get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"23744335","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1418101200000"}},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"10609989","reviewer_name":"Dani","comments":"Passei dez dias com meu marido no apartamento de Adela em Williamsburg.

It's a New York one bedroom, so it's not big, but Ade has done a great job with the space in terms of functionality and aesthetics, and the windows let in a ton of light during the day, so you don't feel cramped.  We stayed during a mid-summer heat wave, so the air-conditioner was key, and even though it doesn't do a great job of cooling down the bedroom, we slept pretty comfortably.  One minor thing to note:  there's no real closet space or drawers to put your belongings.  We're not the type that mind living out of our suitcases, so it didn't necessarily bother us, but I thought it was worth mentioning. \r\n\r\nAde was very quick with her communication, so getting into and checking out of her apartment proved simple and convenient \r\n\r\nI would say this is the perfect place to stay if you want a cute, centrally located Brooklyn home base with easy access to Manhattan and you don't plan on hanging out very much at the apartment... but it's New York, so what the heck are you doing hanging out in an apartment anyway?!?!\r\n"},{"_id":"100491029","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1473393600000"}},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"86205314","reviewer_name":"Jessica","comments":"We had a wonderful time in Williamsburg staying at Ade's place - very clean, tidy and stylish as the pics show!

The apartment is less than a half a block off of Bedford at a location that has a lot of good local bars and restaurants.  We felt very safe though there is a vacant lot that you could walk by on her street.  However, we did not make much of it, but you could walk on the other side of the street if that bothers you.  The street is well lit.  We worried a little about noise given Williamsburg's reputation for hipness.  However, this ended up not being a problem.  Restaurants were still open after 9, but you could still walk into them without reservations.  At night, it was busy enough to feel safe, but it was sparse enough for it to be farely quiet.\n\nGetting into Manhattan can be an issue.  The L train is the only train coming into the neighborhood.  If it isn't running, the closest stop is Marcy at the end of the Williamsburg bridge which is probably a 30 minute walk.  The ferry, which is a bargain, is close and will cross the East River and drop you off at 34th close to the UN Building.  However, it does not run after 9:30 in the evening.\n\nAde's building is a little ratty which you will see in the stairwell.  However, her apartment is perfectly fine.  The bed is comfortable which is nice compared to most Air BNB hosts.  There is a window unit AC for the entire apartment.  Depending on the time of year, I am not sure if it will cool the bedroom well since it's in a different part of the apartment (though there is an oscillating fan there).  We did not have a problem since it was October.  There is no microwave oven.  It is four flights up with pretty large stairs and no elevator.  I would avoid this apartment if you are elderly or handicapped.\n\nWe did not meet Ade which it is getting pretty common not to meet the host.  However, we had no problems.  The process to get the key was easy.  She had recommendations printed and posted in the room, and she was quick to respond to questions by messaging.\n\nFor our purposes, this was a great place to consider if the L train is running.  We would not stay her again if the L train isn't running.  However, if you don't mind working around the ferry schedule and you want to visit Williamsburg and Greenpoint, this will work well for you."},{"_id":"354879082","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1543726800000"}},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"42046158","reviewer_name":"Jeff","comments":"Great location!"},{"_id":"414047344","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1550466000000"}},"listing_id":"103161","reviewer_id":"39745252","reviewer_name":"Rachel","comments":"Ade’s apartment was clean, cozy, and in the heart of Williamsburg.

I booked the home as accommodation for my wedding party guests (my husband and I had a small, beach wedding in the North Shore) and it was perfect. We had everything we needed and the extra beds in each room saved me headache and money - very efficient! Noah was also quite accommodating when I told him our original plan of having the ceremony on the private beach and outside reception in the backyard (which we didn't wind up doing) - he was totally cool with it.

We chose this location for our intimate wedding ceremony and casual dinner for about 45 friends and family. We originally planned both the ceremony and dinner outdoors, but due to the unusually windy weather, we decided to host the dinner in the spacious living room instead, which worked out great. Noah was very responsive and helpful before we arrived in Hawaii, as well as throughout the wedding weekend. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no issues with the hot water, the floors were clean when we arrived, and flies only became an issue when we left the doors open for long periods of time. There wasn't any sand on the beach in early March, but the water was calm and protected - perfect for wading around with water shoes. The house was fully stocked with amenities, and in a fantastic location if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu.

The host was extremely easy to work with and had pre-stocked the house with pots/pans, paper towels, coffee, toilet paper, etc.\n\nThe best part about this house was the location, being right on the coast.  There is a nice back patio, and another concrete slab by the water with steps leading down to the beach.

Host service is a close second. Jenkin is an accessible and attentive host, and that's something you may need in a complicated city like Hong Kong. This is an efficiently designed very small space which makes it seem larger than it is. The layout is (1) a bed-sized sleeping area with a curtain and sliding door for privacy; (2) a comfortably sized and appointed bathroom with a nicely tiled shower with plenty of hot water and strong water pressure; and (3) a living room with comfortable sofa, reliable wifi, and clothes hanging rack. There is a fridge and microwave and hotplate, with enough cookware for two people. You wash your dishes in the bathroom.  All three rooms are recently remodeled and tiled.  The bed is very comfortable. Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\r\n\r\nThe little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \r\n\r\nThe very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \r\n\r\nI might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"73506770","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1462680000000"}},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"65460950","reviewer_name":"Jj","comments":"我们去玩迪士尼很晚回来害怕要找一段时间,地理交通条件好出地铁口走几步就到了,很容易就能找到｡去维多利亚港看完夜景回来到楼下有便利店茶餐厅吃点东西非常方便,房子感觉卫生,有电视和无线网络整体感觉不错!"},{"_id":"74234498","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1463198400000"}},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"31011591","reviewer_name":"Alan","comments":"The apartment is in a great location for exploring the Tsim Sha Sui area.

The living space is small but well organized, with a separate bedroom (just big enough for the bed) with its own air-con, and the bathroom is a very usable size. The main drawback to the apartment is that it is on the 6th floor of a 15 floor building and the queues can get long for the elevator. There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.

Lovely Kowloon Park is very close by as well. The building is older, but it does have an elevator. \nThe apartment is really just a room that is divided into a tiny sleeping area with a sliding glass panel and curtain. There is no kitchen just a fridge, hot water kettle and some dishes, cups, etc. There is no place to even wash cups or dishes other than the bathroom. The apartment is nicely renovated and decorated and the bed and couch are comfortable. The shower pressure is good. It is in a busy shopping and restaurant area but it was quiet enough at night for us to sleep with earplugs. \nWe had a problem at check in. We needed an early check in and I asked for this before booking. Phoebe, the co-host assured me several times that we could arrive early and I reconfirmed the time after I booked it. Unfortunately, Phoebe did not tell her assistant and we arrived to find ourselves locked out. We messaged James and the only response we got was to contact Phoebe. Phoebe couldn’t be reached- later when we spoke she explained that she had lost her phone for a period of time. She was very apologetic and brought us a bottle of wine. No corkscrew in the apartment but still nice of her. The next day we were able to store our luggage for a couple of hours without a problem. \n\nThis place is nice but understand that it is basically a hotel room. I don’t know the prices of hotels in that area but I suspect they’re much higher. It’s a clean, comfortable room in a great location."},{"_id":"230795843","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1517202000000"}},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"66459493","reviewer_name":"Isabel","comments":"Good location  very convenient"},{"_id":"231612401","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1517547600000"}},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"136320456","reviewer_name":"译","comments":"很棒的房间,虽然有点小,不过在市中心这个价格性价比很高了!而且房东响应很迅速!有设备不会用,五分钟内就到了,也很热情!"},{"_id":"236939924","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1519189200000"}},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"166506033","reviewer_name":"海霞","comments":"挺方便的,就是过年期间去确实人多什么都贵"},{"_id":"238059841","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1519534800000"}},"listing_id":"10343118","reviewer_id":"139803774","reviewer_name":"Sandrine","comments":"This appartement is very well located next the MTR station and Nathan Road commercial avenue.

The location is unbeatable, steps from MTR exit, park, mosque, shops, all that TST and HK have to offer.  There's an excellent fried-bao shop on the ground floor!  Finally, the check-in/out was super-easy, and communication with the manager was always rapid and obliging.

So groovy in its 60's mod building - such cool mid-century flourishes.  Perfect for 6, but large enough for 8.  Really huge for an in-city apartment.  Great kitchen, comfortable living room, and just a really cozy and nice apartment to come home to each day after exploring.  Two bathrooms - a rarity in Europe - and a lift in the building for hauling your bags up the stairs.  A little bit out of the tourist center, which in our view provided a more authentic experience.

Osman provided clear instructions to get there and was waiting for us upon our arrival. The other people who man the desk in this building don't really speak English, but they could always call Osman for help which they did. He was helpful with other questions we had too. There was a problem with the plumbing in the bathroom, some leaking around the base of the toilet - which made the small bathroom quite wet. Osman offered to have it fixed while we were there to be fair, but we didn't want a tradesman through during our stay. It will hopefully be repaired when you stay here.

The cottage is very comfortable and equipped with everything you need.   The space is open and roomy, even more so than the listing pics suggest.   As with many Hawaiian dwellings, there are lots of windows, and the cottage offers an open air, indoor/outdoor style of living.   \r\n\r\nAlso of note: the bed is new and king-sized, and is super comfortable-- one of the best I've slept on lately.  Its wonderfully supportive and guarantees a great night's sleep.  Internet access and speeds were very good, something of a priority for me.   Washer and drier out the back door was also a plus.   Out the front door is a picnic table  (put to good use everyday),  and a shady sitting area under a blooming Hong Kong Orchid tree-- delightful.\r\n\r\nThe cottage basically sits on its own parcel, with your own private driveway, and so it offers good privacy.   The location is somewhat off the beaten path, which I found desirable, as areas of the North Shore can get busy at times.  Still, there's easy access to area beaches, shopping in Haleiwa, the weekend farmer's market's, etc.   And then there's literally miles of amazing beaches to explore from the cottage to Ka'ena Point.   \r\n\r\nSaving the best for last: Bobby and Mike are excellent hosts and genuinely lovely people-- the aloha spirit here is awesome.  Both are very friendly and  accommodating,  generously sharing weekend BBQ dishes (delicious!) and providing a fresh pineapple to welcome their guest.   I had a great time at the Banyan Bungalow-- only wish I could have stayed longer.

I booked this over another place because of a review that the king size bed is comfortable - and it definitely was! There's a beach close by, and I was often the only one on it (or only with a few others), which is incredible to find for the busy island.

Her directions were clear and it was easy to find.  I had my own drive and garden, complete with outdoor table and grill.  The cottage was exactly as in the pictures and Bobby had left some local treats including freshly laid eggs from her own hens for me! The area is so safe you don't need to shut the doors and it is quiet as anything-except for the wild roosters, but these are everywhere in Hawaii and you get used to them very quickly.  The beach is a short walk away, and Bobby loaned me a beach cruiser bicycle so I could ride into the North Shore town of Haleiwa which was on bike paths all the way.  The cottage also has a great outdoor shower which is perfect for ending a trip to the beach.\r\n\r\nWaialua is the real Hawaii, it is quiet and away from most of the touristy stuff and it was very nice not to be in Wakiki!  But still only a short drive to historic Haleiwa which has restaurants and shops.  I cooked for myself most evenings in the cottage which was easy enough on the hot plate and the cottage was very peaceful in the evening, with fantastic starts to be watched from the garden after dark.   Bobby also brought me fresh pineapple from the plantation and the mangos at this time of year were so delicious- another fantastic touch!\r\n\r\nI'd really recommend staying with Bobby if you are looking for a peaceful, North Shore, real Hawaii stay.  It was absolutely fantastic-and the bed is massive and super comfortable!  Great value and really super!   Bobby is a great host, she was really welcoming and always contactable but left me to my privacy too.  She went out of her way to help me get some mail I was expecting and had great recommendations about the area.

Located on the beautiful North Shore, this rental is peaceful and perfectly situated to allow you to have an amazing time exploring the island. Very close to Ka'ena Point, where we saw wild whales migrating off the coast, and to the lovely surf town of Hale'iwa. There's a secluded beach in close walking distance, and we also used our rental car to explore some of the incredible beaches within a short drive, like Waimea Bay. The space itself was clean and well-equipped, with a very comfortable king size bed! Bobby was very easy to communicate with and we felt so well taken care of, right down to the arrival treats that were left for us (very appreciated after a long flight!). I'll echo what some others have mentioned here, which is to bring earplugs for nighttime sleeping, as there are junglefowl all over the island (wild chickens!) and the roosters do like to announce their presence at all hours - you'll hear this everywhere you go. I highly recommend this Airbnb rental!

I absolutely loved Bobby's cottage in Waialua! The cottage was so peaceful and relaxing. I was so happy with how private the space was. Just like the ad described, it has its own driveway and completely private space, the adjacent houses were even separated by a fence.  The space was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with games, towels, snacks, and other supplies. I wish we didn't have to run around so much that weekend so that we could have enjoyed the cottage more. We didn't even get to cut open the fresh pineapple that Bobby left for us! Although I did enjoy the crackers and peanut butter :) \n\nThis is the perfect weekend getaway for locals, or vacation spot for out of towners looking for a peaceful getaway. If you want to be be closer to the hustle and bustle, then I would look for a place closer to Haleiwa or Sunset. It is pretty quiet here (minus the roosters in the am), and other than the beach, it is not really walking distance to much. Which we loved actually :) Also, I really appreciated that Bobby was readily available to help with directions and check-in details, but more importantly that she gave us privacy and space once we checked in. \n\nIf I ever need to come back up the North Shore for a relaxing weekend, I would certainly book again!

The bungalow is clean, open, and roomy, with a giant, comfortable California King size bed in the middle and a kitchen housing all the essentials (glasses, plates, silverware, coffee maker, ice trays, etc.). \n\nThere is also a television and WiFi available, which we used to connect to Spotify for some music. But oh, the sounds, the sounds, the sounds!\n\nI actually chose this reservation because of the reviews which described the sounds of the North Shore. I love chickens and birds and grew up with their gentle AM serenades, therefore this place was perfect. The roosters sang to impress while other birds crooned and cackled, creating a beautiful medley of island sounds that makes this place unique.\n\nThere is a giant yard and private gate on the outside of the bungalow, and an outdoor shower which was perfect for hosing off all the sand from the luscious beach. \n\nAnd the beach, what a beach it was! Upon arrival Bobby and her partner greeted us with a fresh pineapple and gave us directions to the ocean and encouraged us to use their cruiser bicycles. The beach is about a ten-minute walk or a three-minute bike ride -- either journey is pleasant, with the bike ride maybe being better because it gets you there faster.\n\nPicture all the noise and umbrellas and kayaks and floaties of Waikiki Beach, and all the surfers and gatherers of those at say, Banzai Pipeline, and then picture the exact opposite. The beach in this spot was quiet, with gentle, clean waves and at most I saw a maximum of about eight other people who were either snorkeling or just hanging out with dogs.\n\nAt one point, after relaxing on the beach for so long, my partner and I took a nap and were awakened by a friendly pooch named Tucker, who was all smiles as we gave him pets and ear scratches (sorry if that was TMI, we are dog people after all).\n\nI could yam on and on about this place, but I think I've done all the yamming I could possible yam.\n\nI give this place ten stars out of five, and the hosts also ten stars out of five.\n\nDid I mention we really enjoyed our stay?"},{"_id":"152686437","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1494993600000"}},"listing_id":"10392282","reviewer_id":"6031468","reviewer_name":"Hannah","comments":"My Husband and I absolutely loved out stay in Bobby's Bungalow.

Very nice, spacious and ideal for a couple. The place is very well decorated, a nice large bed and enough room to really make you feel at home. Very private setting, including private access and parking.\nThe host was very accomodating and communication was nearly immediate. In fact, on our last morning I texted to let her know we'd be going for a quick snorkle at Wiamea Bay (15 min drive) and back by 9:30 to check out at 10. She was gracious enough to allow for a later checkout which turned out to be marvelous. \nYou must have a car to stay here. No public transportation available and Uber would be potentially challenging.\nThe beach at the end of the street (down the street, take a right for a short distance) was fantastic for a semi-private location with good swimming. The water is fairly shallow with ok snorkeling. Bikes had flat tires so we drove. Not a huge deal. \nThe Roosters - I have to say that as charming as the chickens and chicks are that roam the North Shore (we have some at home), the roosters are quite challenging in the mornings, and for certain guests, this could be a deal breaker for this particular location. We did have one night that a couple in the neighborhood tested their vocal cords at 3:30 am for a few minutes. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wanted to strangle a few of them, but we were up and going each morning anyway so this wasn't a deal breaker for us. \nWe loved this location and would stay again."},{"_id":"243983470","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1521259200000"}},"listing_id":"10392282","reviewer_id":"140981747","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"This bungalow is quiet and accommodating.

It’s in a remote part of Oahu, so expect to be in the countryside - waking up early to chickens & birds chirping. No AC, so it can be hot and steamy even with windows and fans (depending on time you visit). Bobby was super flexible and communicative which was very appreciated. The bikes were great, we rode those to the beach and into the main town of Haleiwa (about 5 miles). They provide a lock so it allowed us to adventure and get some breakfast. We couldn’t find the snorkel gear people mentioned so we rented some. A few bugs, but it was likely due to the rain before our stay.

This location was perfect for a wedding we had out in Waialua over the weekend, it was no more than a 5 minute drive as opposed to an hour and a half long drive back home. \n\nI'm so very thankful for their hospitality and their generosity during our stay!!!

It's all open windows and pure bliss.  There is a separate, gated driveway to the bungalow with a ton of outdoor space and lawn furniture you can hang out in.   I wasn't expecting how big the studio really is.  There are thoughtful decorations that make you believe someone has put a lot of time and thought into this place.  \nThe beach is beautiful and within about a 5 minute walk (10 if you stroll and take photos of all the flowers along the way.)  My second day, I took one of the 3 bikes provided and rode the way to Hale'iwa.  Just go out the driveway, turn left and take a right at the end of the street.  Beach access is along the way and a bike path eventually opens up and it's a lovely drive with mountains on one side and beach on the other. \nI didn't get to meet the hosts since I got in rather late, but check in instructions were sent to me and really easy to follow.   I loved everything about this place and should I find myself on Oahu again, I'll definitely be back to this bungalow."},{"_id":"411265747","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1549861200000"}},"listing_id":"10392282","reviewer_id":"75072705","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"We had a great visit to Waialua on the North Shore.

Fica no coração de Ipanema, a poucas quadras da praia e muito próximo da Lagoa. Na região, muitas lojas legais, bares para curtir o final de tarde e restaurantes deliciosos; tem estação de metrô a 50 metros do apartamento. A região é muita tranquila e segura, perfeita para uma caminhada matinal ou desbravar o bairro. O espaço da Liliane é realmente como na descrição, com quartos amplos (os dois são Suites), cozinha equipada e uma ótima área de lazer, com piscina e hidromassagem que podem ser usadas pelos hóspedes.  A Liliane foi muito atenciosa, desde antes do checkin; ela tem boas indicações de resultantes e lugares para conhecer na região. O apartamento deixou minha viagem do Rio mais linda.

Uma consequência disso eh que tive que gastar 30 euros com ligações telefônicas usando um chip francês quando cheguei no aeroporto para me comunicar com ela e perguntar coisas básicas que não foram informadas: número da rua, com quem pegaríamos a chave, o horário em que poderíamos entrar etc\n- além disso, apesar de ter usado o Airbnb inúmeras vezes, essa é a primeira vez que ninguém nos recebeu. Não vimos a anfitriã ou a agência que ela contrata ou outra pessoa em nenhum momento. Nós chegamos, pedimos as chaves ao porteiro, a maneira de abrir a garagem, onde estacionar, por onde entrar quando chegamos da praia etc. Fomos perguntando quando as dúvidas surgiam pq ninguém nos fez uma apresentação do lugar. Eles vendem um serviço como se fosse um produto, e sem muito atendimento ao cliente.\n- o lugar estava empoeirado. Nitidamente ninguém realizou uma limpeza previa à nossa chegada. Não era nada gritante,  mas bolas de poeira e sujeira no chão do quarto e embaixo dos móveis podiam ser vistas com facilidade\n- a cafeteira estava quebrada, e como eu não tinha muita esperança de que alguém se dispusesse a ir até lá, resolvi comprar uma cafeteira por 80 reais, que depois deixamos com familiares no RJ. O objetivo não era de comprá-la, mas devido aos fatos expostos acima fizemos um cálculo de custo/benefícios e nos resignamos na compra de uma cafeteira que não precisaríamos depois\n- o ar condicionado dos quartos tem apenas dois modos: desligado ou frio glacial, o que nos força a ligar e desligar constantemente pra manter uma temperatura razoável, inclusive no meio da noite. Em um dos quartos ele é bem barulhento. O ar condicionado da sala também tem dois modos apenas: desligado ou fraquinho, o que é particularmente chato quando se está na cozinha quente que não se resfria com ele (a cozinha é americana e dá sobre a sala)\n- por último, mas isso é menos importante pq a piscina fecha cedo, quando alguém nada nela uma das varandas treme bastante, o que reverbera sobre o quarto, fazendo um barulho como se alguém no andar de cima estivesse pulando.\n\nEm resumo, o apartamento em si é bom, mas a ausência quase total de manutenção e alguém pra auxiliar com coisas tão simples como apresentar o lugar, informar horários, dizer o endereço exato, dizer as regras do lugar, substituir uma cafeteira quebrada ou limpar o apartamento de vez em quando faz com que ele esteja caro para o serviço prestado.\n\nEsperamos ter ajudado outras pessoas a tomar uma escolha sábia, e também esperamos que a anfitriã  se torne mais presente na plataforma e pressione a agência que ela contrata para melhorar determinados pontos do serviço proposto.\n\nDanilo & Marine"}]}

I enjoyed my morning tea and fruit provided by Leslie on the deck with a quintessential Australian view; a kookaburra sitting on a nearby television aerial and the Manly ferries on the harbour.

The kitchen is well equipped. This place could be used just as easily for a long stay as it was for our shorter one. We were there for three days. Leslie was a very thoughtful host, leaving wine and chocolates in the fridge, and even brought by Band-Aids for me when I got a really bad blister from my new shoes. \n\nDOWNSIDES:\nAs mentioned in previous reviews, the basement holds moisture. As long as you keep using the de-humidifier, you’ll be okay. \n\nA major problem we had was Sydney’s inconsistent public transit, more specifically the buses. If you’re used to relying on transit, look for a place that is closer to the central parts of town. I think of all the buses we took, we had ONE arrive on time. Some showed up 10 minutes after the scheduled time, and one didn’t even show up at all. So, look for something nearer the main harbour or CBD, or you can do like we did a lot of the time: walk down to the Manly Wharf (about 25 min walk) and take the ferry to the main harbour, and only stick to the areas that are closest. Honestly, take the ferries as much as possible. The views are phenomenal.

Bondi Beach must be its sister city times two. As a bunch of aged birdwatchers we didn't really fit in but felt comfortable and accepted anyway. Lots of shops and good restaurants within easy walking distance, and the beach is just as close. There's even a funky little nine hole golf course close by. It's perched on a cliff that overlooks the ocean and has million dollar views.\n\nThe house worked well for five adults (one couple and three others) and was clean and well appointed. There are even cookbooks displayed in the kitchen in case you wanted to get adventurous. One of the bedrooms is in a guesthouse in the back yard and it was a nice place for the couple to sleep and be apart form the others. Be prepared for visiting bugs, though.\n\nBelieve Cat when she says that you won't be able to park inside the gate without a high clearance vehicle but you will be able to park in the driveway if your car is on the small side. We had a minivan that was simply too big to allow for pedestrians pushing baby strollers to get by. Parking on the street is for two hours only and the nearest long-term free parking is s few blocks away. Remember to always leave space between you and the next car as locals seem to have no issue with pinning you in if you don't. \n\nCat was great about communicating with us. She seemed available at all times, promptly answering any questions that we had.\n\nEric\nVancouver, WA \nUSA"},{"_id":"124881102","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1483333200000"}},"listing_id":"10423504","reviewer_id":"56832913","reviewer_name":"Lorraine","comments":"This accommodation is in a lovely location, quiet close to the beach.

It was the best experience ever.  Cat is an extremely gracious hostess.  Very friendly, great communication and really thoughtful, unexpectedly offering us early check in and late check out because it was possible. \n\nThe house has a lovely friendly feel to it, and is as amazing as the pictures look, they are accurate.   Loved sitting in the beautiful courtyard, sipping champagne and enjoying the fish.\n\nSo many small attentions to detail.... having champagne stoppers, insect repellant and a really helpful guide to the house and how to navigate the surrounding areas. Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.\n\nGreat location. The house is a very easy walk to Bondi Beach, even for unfit me, and an even shorter walk to groceries, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants.\n\nParking is the only thing that is a bit awkward.  The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.  We were able to get longer stay parking in other streets, but this obviously wasn't as convenient. It was doable though.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay and intend to stay there again."},{"_id":"253583288","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1523764800000"}},"listing_id":"10423504","reviewer_id":"23043423","reviewer_name":"Stefana","comments":"Stayed for a hens weekend, very central location and access to everything in Bondi.

We were able to cuddle up in the comfy couch after a day on the beach. \n\nWe are especially grateful for our experience here because we had to cancel our previous place at the rocks.  The host there was unaffected with our concerns. All of which were half heartedly addressed, if at all.  The house at the rocks where we stayed had a terrible mold problem. My poor son was having asthma attacks. \n\nLuckily, Cat was able to accommodate last minute and she was sure to deal with any concerns we had right away. But we didn’t have any. Everything was great, you won’t be disappointed."}]}

We were able to see many sights and surrounding towns, yet get in beautiful beach time. The building and condo is well maintained, and the grounds are landscaped very nicely.  The sound of the ocean and the palm trees at night in the bedroom made for a relaxing way to fall asleep. There are all the needed beach necessities and the kitchen is well appointed. We also enjoyed listening to the Hawaiian Cd's that were available in the apartment. It was a good introduction to the Slack Key style and added to the ambiance.   \r\n\r\nDon't forget to take a walk to the farmer's market and Sugar Beach Bake shop. It was our favorite way to start the morning. There are several supermarkets / drug stores within a 10 minute drive or less should you need anything. \r\n\r\nWe hope to visit again someday soon!

También a unos cuantos metros puedes coger el metro que te deja en la parte alta del centro de Oporto pero es bastante ruidoso.\r\nEl piso está muy bien para los que quieren combinar playa con ambiente de la ciudad de Oporto.\r\nNosotros íbamos en familia con niños (12-14) y nos encajó bien. Pasamos un par de días en Oporto (pateada, paseo en barco, funicular, telesférico, tranvía...) y otros dos en Matoshinos y en Leca da Palmeira (surf, piscinas de mar, baños...).

Also crystal had informed us that she wont be around during a certain time a few days earlier but we'd left for macau/hong kong just a day before she sent us a email, which made things worse, as none of us had bought the local sim card and i didnt check my email. And since we didnt know which flat she was stayign in, we couldnt even tell the guards there, for them to allow us go up. when we asked the guard if there was wifi at the lobby, sadly there was none so we couldnt get into airbnb. so we had to get the local sim card and connect to the internet so i could check my email. thank god her husband mike, left his contact number and flat number via email. basically the timing was so wrong. cant entirely blame it on crystal.  otherwise everything was good. the space was a bit small, location is walking distance from Mongkok East station. So that was really good for moving around. Hardly got to meet crystal but her husband mike was always around  in the evenings. so, he gave us quite a tip to take a cab to go to the airport rather than taking the MTR especially if you have luggage. \r\n\r\nmain tip: take the train to mongkok east, and check your email/airbnb a day before and on the day of arrival in hong kong for updates your host has left for you.

It was more silent than me. \r\n\r\nI didn't make much use of the flat as a whole, but stayed mostly in my room. Have to say, I really liked the husband as did my friend.

Also, the house looks perfectly the same as it looks in the pictures. The room is small but enough for one-two nights in Hong Kong. The most important thing is that everything was clean and we rest 100% in the room provided. The only thing we are disappointed with is that we couldn't have a chat with them and it could have been a great help for our visit in Hong Kong giving us some tips about the city. That's how Airbnb works, experience in a local house to share a small chat or even a coffee but it wasn't nothing like that.

We arrived and were greeted by the very friendly and attentive Cath - who introduced us to the chickens on the way to the studio. As soon as we stepped inside we felt comfortable. The decor is modern, quirky and stylish, there is a lovely area to sit and watch television, a user friendly kitchenette, a comfortable bed and a clean and modern bathroom. Cath provided us with a lovely array of breakfast and snack options and she even baked a delicious loaf of fresh bread which she left at our doorstep the following morning along with a newspaper. There is a large collection of DVD's to watch and books to read and the studio is in a quiet location with plenty parking - also within easy walking distance of public transport.

Such warmth and sincere hospitality. Handed a loaf of baked bread straight from the oven within moments was an unexpected delight. The beautifully styled and thoughtfully prepared space is ideal. We felt that the attention to detail was the best we have experienced using AirBNB. From the generously stocked fridge and hamper, bathroom items, games, videos and books and even picnic gear it was clear the stylish owner is well travelled and knows how to make a space a temporary home. The kitchenette has everything you need. In fact the space and the lovely courtyard was so delightful we surprised ourselves by spending the first morning there enjoying a lazy breakfast reading the terrific range of wonderful magazines rather than head out. The location is great. At the end of the street is a lovely park where we were able to fit in a morning run. Very comfy bed, quality linen, a super quiet fan. Great information and maps were a welcome addition. We would love to return here and most likely will. Highly recommended.

Everything is done to a really high quality level, from the sheets on the perfectly made bed to the spotless interior and the fantastic breakfast box Cath left for me.  The garden is a wonderful and quiet place to hang out, although it is definitely shared between you and the host.  Privacy feels more private that a room in someone else's house, but probably less than a stand-alone apartment - reasonable since it's a studio in someone's back garden.  The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, with nice cafes and a farmer's market a 15-minute walk.  Getting into and out of other places in the city takes a while; you are not in the center of things, but in a nice neighborhood.  A car or a bike would be more flexible than using transit.

The Garden Studio was fantastic. I felt so comfortable staying there, that I completely forgot that it was located at the back of Cath's house. Cath has done an amazing job with making her guests feel welcome and well cared for. The breakfast hamper was beautiful (especially since I'm a fussy eater!!) fresh bread, home made jam, milk, juice, coffee, herbal teas etc etc was ALL provided. Being a tourist to Sydney, the information folder Cath has put together herself was extremely helpful. One night I tried one of her recommended restaurants and the food was amazing.

We were warmly greeted by Cath, and Chips the dog, and once inside the studio there was a lovely hamper of breakfast foods, fresh bread, a coffee machine and various teas - breakfast then sorted for the next four days.\r\nThe studio is in Cath's garden, with a paved area and table and chairs for sitting in the sun.  While it is small it is very sunny and really well set out with modern furniture and we loved the loft bed.  The bathroom area has a shower curtain, not a door but that was not a problem for us. \r\nCath - thank you very much for making our stay so nice.  Your home baking left for us on one of the days was really thoughtful.

Before we arrived Cath contacted us to ensure her breakfast hamper contained things we liked. In additional to the hamper, each day we were treated to a range of treats including fresh eggs, delicious cakes or freshly baked bread. Even the paper was delivered most days courtesy of Chips the guide dog in training. After eight days we rolled out of the Garden Studio wishing we could stay indefinitely.

The little details matter like the umbrellas, picnic basket, extra blankets, etc that were provided to us. The studio is not located within the CBD area but that was not a problem at all since we were commuting around via trains and buses and did not find any issues doing so. Also it is in a suburb very close to the central area so you are still pretty close. Besides Marickville has some of the best food and coffee options that we explored in our trip.

Cath's recommendations for local must-dos were much appreciated. The street is lovely and quiet, with a park at the end. Getting to and from the train was also a breeze.

(great walking distance for all the events), Easily accessible to subway, tram, ferries. The neighbourhood is friendly and diverse. It is only 3 minutes by walk to the Galatasaray Square which is located approximately at the center of the Istiklal Avenue. Istiklal Avenue is located in the historic Beyoğlu (Pera) district, it is an elegant pedestrian street, 1.4 kilometers long, which houses boutiques, music stores, bookstores, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, libraries, cafés, pubs, night clubs with live music, historical patisseries, chocolateries and restaurants.  You should definately walk through the local bazaar on Sunday right beside the apartment. You can find anything you need with cheap prices; fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, meat, dairy products! Local bazaars will be very helpful to understand the culture of Turkish people as well. There are couple of restaurants close by where yo","notes":"From/To Airports: There are several ways to get from the airport to the apartment, but the most convenient manner is to take “HAVATAŞ\" shuttle to Taksim Square departing every 30 minutes from the airport (from both airports- Atatürk and Sabiha Gökçen). As you may be unfamiliar with the area, I am happy to come and pick you up in front of Galatasaray Highschool (on Istiklal Street) which is 10 minutes walk from Taksim Square where you will get off. I can always advise you cheaper public transport options if you ask for. Useful information: You can rent the apartment/room for (a) day(s), week, month or longer periods of time.  There is various supermarkets conveniently situated a block away from the apartment on the way to Istiklal street, also a small kiosk right next to the apartment and a laundry in 100 meters distance.","transit":"Getting around by Walk, Subway, Bus, Tram, Ferry, Tunnel: You can take one of the world's oldest tram on Istiklal street by 3 minutes walk from the apartment on Istiklal street. By tram you can end up in Istanbul’s Tunnel (Tünel) which is the world’s shortest and third-oldest passenger terminal. This one-stop funicular climbs the steeply uphill for 500 meters from Karaköy to Tünel and the other way around. Karaköy is today a major transport hub for intercity and also a house of unique cafes and galleries. We can count Karaköy for the city's recent hip?? district. The Galata Bridge connects Karaköy with the Old City, on which the fast tram line Zeytinburnu-Kabataş runs with. This tram line goes to Atatürk Airport within 1 hour. Ferry boats run every 10 to 20 minutes from the ferry terminal on a pontoon to Haydarpaşa train terminal and Kadıköy across the Asian shore of Bosphorus. You should definately walk throgh Kadıköy at day/night time. Many different tastes of joy. It is also only tw","access":"First of all you will have access to everything in the apartment.

Commute from and to the airport was a breeze with a toddler because she took care of the booking of the transportation. She was also always responsive on (Hidden by Airbnb) and over phone. I might have expected her house to be slightly more than what I imagined from the pictures but it was comfortable and equipped nevertheless. So that wasn’t a big deal. The location of the house is very close to the busy İstiklal street and the bus stop ‘Ömer Hayyam’ has frequent connectivity to ‘Taksim Square’ and Ominonu. The only downside we felt was we had to climb stairs to reach the bus stop and it was not fun to do so with a stroller to carry around. But without a stroller I’d not have worried about this situation. Our 5 day stay was comfortable expect the continuous rain dampened spirit a bit. Her parents whom we met on the day we left were very sweet people. Overall I’m thankful to Aybike for her hospitality and everything."},{"_id":"363146297","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1545973200000"}},"listing_id":"10486984","reviewer_id":"220447046","reviewer_name":"Rawan","comments":"First just i want too say thank u for the apartment owner.. because she was very nice with me ..

All exceeded expectations! Her communication, quick responses, her help on local tips and private transfer she arranged are superb. Good area with close distance to restaurants and subway. The only thing I’d say is that street is kinda noisy so that if apartment would be packed it worth to bring ear plugs with you as only one room (which is close to window to street) sometimes is noisy. Otherwise that’s more than you can expect! Aybike is great host! Thanks for hosting us.

А также высокий шум с улицы, который не прекращается даже ночью. Шум, преимущественно, исходит от лежачего полицейского, который устроен в виде больших граблей, расположенных таким образом, чтобы машины могли ехать только в одном направлении. Улица, на которую выходят окна квартиры, с односторонним движением и грабли срабатывают с изящным скрежетом каждый раз, когда на лежачий полицейский наезжают колеса автотранспорта. \n\tВ остальном хозяйка сделала все возможное для нашего комфортного проживания.

The place is really near to Taksim Square. Once you get out from the house, you can just walk up around 5 minutes. Then, you will be at the Istiklal Street and it just 5 minutes walk to get to Taksim Square. Also, it is so nearby to Galata Tower too. It is easy to connect with public transportation as the metro station is just nearby. This place is also nearby to the Istiklal Street. The famous shopping street in Istanbul. So, I highly recommend this place to anyone out there when you want to visit Istanbul. Aybike is a very good host. She offered me a help if i had left something in Bursa.

O condominio é bem grande, fica na frente da praia mas tem uma pequena caminhada dentro dele pra chegar até a saída. Nada longo se vc não estiver carregando muita coisa. A comunicação com a Paula foi maravilhosa. Ela sempre respondeu tudo muito rápido e o acesso ao apartamento foi tranquilo. O fato de ter um cofre na porta de entrada ajuda muito se vc estiver viajando com outras pessoas. Assim a chave fica sempre guardada lá para caso as pessoas cheguem separadas no apto. Muito funcional.\nA única coisa que eu sugeri pra Paula é ter toalhas. Chegamos lá e não encontramos toalhas. Apenas roupas de cama. Mesmo o anuncio dizendo que o apartamento não tinha, essa informação fica um pouco escondida em \"básicos\". Só percebi que \"básico\" era toalhas, roupa de cama e sabonetes depois que cheguei.

The windows look out onto the stream as described.. but it was more like a being in a jungle house! with the rushing stream below, the canopy of the trees and noises from the frogs it truly felt like you were in an exotic jungle location. Everything went smoothly from check-in to check-out. We didn't end up using the pool, but did check it out. Hoping to be back to stay!

This could make some issues irrelevant for people who intend to stay for a few days to 1 week. \n\nHost:\nGuillermo is a very considerate host and genuinely wants guests to have a great stay. His communications are very quick and he is also very quick in responding to any issues. He is a really nice guy and trustworthy. He personally responds to issues and even got us a microwave oven on request, which was very kind of him. \n\nNoise:\nOne issue we had with the apartment is noise. This is obviously nothing to do with the host but it can't really be ignored in a review. There is a cement factory right behind the apartment and a welders/metal works opposite it. This is going to make noise. Both start work very early in the morning so we often were woke up by the beeping of trucks reversing and the grinding of the metal works across the road. They both work 6 days a week. Probably not an issue for a few days but having that noise every morning for a month is annoying. \n\nArea:\nThe area (Bushwick) is very different to Williamsburg even though some people call it East Williamsburg. Bushwick is more like real life. Good variety of people and cultures and we found it very safe. Plenty of amenities close by. Getting into Manhattan is very simple. L train is 5 stops away from East Village which is great. Bushwick has artists' residence and an amazing Pizza place called Roberta's, which is a must. There is very impressive street art (lots of it) about 5 minutes away. \n\nRooms:\nThe bathroom is new and everything works well. Kitchen is ok but a little limited. We did have some issues with the power going a couple of times in there. It does need re-wiring. The Lounge is nice. TV has Netflix and the Air Con is pretty good and keeps the apartment cool. WiFi is quick. The bed was comfortable. The Furniture is pretty good. Sofa is comfortable and fairly new and it has a good desk and a place to hang clothes. \n\nCleanliness:\nIn addition to the surrounding noise, the only other issue we had was the cleanliness of the apartment. It looks pretty clean when you arrive but the floor left your feet dirty if you walked around barefoot and when you inspected a little closer (behind sofa or fridge) it was pretty dirty. there is a collection of thick dust in-between the bars of the radiators and there was a strange smell by the bed, which we couldn't work out what it was? Bathroom was very clean. It is an old building/apartment and needs a little TLC in terms of the flooring."},{"_id":"182028746","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1502596800000"}},"listing_id":"10545815","reviewer_id":"5042213","reviewer_name":"María Soledad","comments":"We had a great stay at Guillermo's apartment.

Cool place with delicious pizza - unfortunately super busy - even on a Thursday evening - so it seems reservations would be recommended. You can take a cab from the Newark Airport to get there, which is 130$ and takes an hour or you choose the NJ Transit and subway transport which is way cheeper but takes you about 2 hours.

Perfect. \n\n Williamsburg in itself it a really wonderful location with a very relaxed vibe which we both enjoyed greatly.

The apartment is not in the heart of Williamsburg, more on the outskirts but it’s only 5 mins into Williamsburg and 15 into Manhattan on the subway (the nearest station is a few minutes walk). \n\nThe area looks a little shady when you first arrive but we had no issues at all. There is a pizza place and other takeouts, grocery stores and a couple bars all near the subway station.\n\nGuillermo was very responsive and provided us with all the info we needed in plenty of time. He also gave us phone numbers in case we needed them.\n\nThe apartment is lovely and spacious and the bathroom and kitchen were spotless. It was freezing when we visited and the apartment was always lovely and warm. The only notes I would make is that the blinds in the apartment aren’t very thick so if you are a light sleeper you may want to take a sleep mask. Also, there isn’t really any storage space for you clothes. It’s fine if you’re there for a week (like is) but might be a bit of an issue for people staying longer.\n\nAll in all it is a great base to explore the city and I would definitely stay again on my next trip to New York."},{"_id":"362961850","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1545886800000"}},"listing_id":"10545815","reviewer_id":"32466225","reviewer_name":"Daniel","comments":"Great place, would recommend this place if you want to see new part of NY.

The newly remodeled house was spacious and very clean.  Nate was super nice and very responsive.  The lanai out front was our favorite place to relax and gather morning and evening.  The beds were very comfortable.  The refrigerator was huge.  With a car, we had easy access to the whole coast north and south of Kona.  The snorkeling and other beach gear that came with the house also made our stay easier and more fun!\nThe only con: Two members of our group needed the A/C to sleep.  We found that the A/C in the bedrooms upstairs were kind of loud as it shut off and on through the night.  And the house rule of running it at a 75 degree minimum still seemed warm to us.  But it was still better than nothing, since we didn't want to keep all the bedroom doors open all night to catch the cross breezes (for privacy and to manage the snorers).\nOverall, I would easily recommend this place!

Nate's home is very well presented and was perfect for our family of 6 - with four very generous bedrooms. The beds themselves are very comfortable and the house is situated in a nice quite location.\nWe hired a car which was advantageous, as a 5minute drive to main street but too far to walk.

Loved the wraparound lanai, especially with the lovely view of the ocean.  We cooked most of our meals at the house so it was convenient and helped us save a ton of money.  We also enjoyed eating out at the restaurants suggested by Nate (we loved Lava Java).  The house is fully equipped with beach equipment/toys which we didn't really use (we brought our own) but know that it's there.  Easy access to town and highway.

It's beautiful, clean, close to everything, and has a wonderful view. We went to Kona for a family wedding and it was great to have a big house together as opposed to several hotel rooms. In the mornings we had coffee on the lanai while we looked out at the ocean--so lovely! Nate was a wonderful host. He got back to us right away each time we needed something. We did wish for AC window units in the downstairs bedrooms like the ones upstairs. But we were there in August, the hottest time of the year. It probably wouldn't be a big deal to go without AC most of the year. There is usually a nice ocean breeze.

We didn’t have a lot of breeze when we opened up the windows but that’s probably unusual.  There was an upstairs and downstairs living space and refrigerator.\n\nAmenities offered included beach chairs which was great for us - these were to be shared with another property.  We didn’t notice any beach towels but perhaps we didn’t look hard enough since we had our own.  \n\nI admit that I did not realize that only the upstairs living room and bedrooms had AC units, but it was written in the description so I do not fault the host for this - some of our party were very hot downstairs so they just stayed upstairs.  Washer and dryer were on premises but locked up unless asked for - we did have to buy our own laundry detergent.\n\nAll in all, the description was accurate regarding the home.

El sofá donde supuestamente se podía dormir, tenía una gran mancha que ni se habían molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo había un único armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos tocó limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hacía inútil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada más llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendió una persona que ni siquiera sabía hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 € en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada más cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitrión, absolutamente ninguno.

First of all, the following guests should know that the pretty view on the pictures is not seen from inside the apartment - not of the windows, no out of the terrace either. That was a big letdown for us. You can see the view only from outside of the building and that's quite confusing. Second, you should know that the mouldy smell on the bedding and the big bedroom are unbearable. Me and my husband couldn't sleep there, it was awful. Fortunately we manage to arrange that problem and sleep in the dining room on the couch that become a bed. The main problem in Regina's apartment is the mouldy smell that she explained is due to the location of the apartment. In spite of all that, Regina was very helpful host. She let us leave our luggage at their family hotel on chek-out day because we had 4 hours to spare before going to the airport. We had a great time mainly on the terrace which is right next to the kitchen. The neighborhood was great - quiet, there is a big market and bus stops very close by. Very easy to get to the city center and even the night buses stopped very close. Bunkers de can Baro are very close to the apartment - 1o min. walk up on the hill. They were spectacular.

I also messaged her about it and she was sure that it was in the kitchen but then I looked back in some of the reviews and found a couple of them that says they couldn’t find it either. It seems like she doesn’t really know her own listing that well. \n\nWe never actually met Alexandra and checked in with her friend, Anastasia. She checked us in right at 2 pm and was  nice. \n\nThe apartment itself was clean and the couch is actually better than the one in the pictures but some of the decorations were different. No biggie though. \n\nThe only thing about the apartment is there is ONLY ONE FAN. There are 2 bedrooms and 3 sleeping areas but we shared one fan which was impossible.

The Zona Sul, an upmarket supermarket indeed around the corner (corner Rua Jardim Botanico and Rua Pacheco Leao). We very much liked La Biciclette for breakfast, it is a French bakery on the corner of Rua Pacheco Leao and Rua Von Martius. Also we liked the restaurant SOBE in the Rua Pacheco Leao. Good starters, great view on the Christ as it is partly an open-air restaurant.

Two things to keep in mind - it's really quite a small space (standard for Rio, but perhaps a surprise for guests who arrive from outside Brazil) and you hear a lot of street noise, so it's perhaps not ideal for light sleepers.

We are located very close to 7th Avenue, which has all kinds of shopping. There are fine groceries such as Union Market, several good delis, some of the best bagels in New York at the Bagel Hole,etc., as well as restaurants with food from every corner of the globe, ranging from higher end fare at places like Talde to our local diner located right on the corner of the block.  Many fine coffee shops, bars and stores of every description are also only a short walk away, as is Prospect Park (located two blocks away) with its many wide open spaces and forest paths, where you can forget for a while that you are in a big city.","notes":"Please, no smoking, no pets, and no parties, and please use the recycling bins.","transit":"SUBWAY We are located three short blocks from the 7th Avenue subway station on the F and G lines. The F train is the easiest way to get to Manhattan, about 20 minutes from Greenwich Village, and there are easy transfer points along the F line that will get you anywhere you need to go in Manhattan. The G train does not go into Manhattan but offers easy access to Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood and locations in Queens.  BUSES The 67 and 69 buses run along 7th avenue, and the 61 bus that runs along 9th street is also very close.  TAXI There are often green or yellow NYC taxis around. The green taxis work the same as the yellow but are designated specifically to stop in Brooklyn and boroughs other than Manhattan. There are many car services in the neighborhood as well (we’ve had pretty good luck with Eastern). PARKING There is free parking on the numbered streets and metered parking on 7th Avenue. Read signs carefully for street cleaning rules.  CAR RENTAL There are many Zipcar locati","access":"The apartment is located on the ground floor of our townhouse. There is a separate outdoor entrance that opens from the bottom of the stoop on the left. Once inside, there is another key which opens the door to the apartment, located immediately on your left.

We will either be available to hand you the keys ourselves or make other arrangements if you arrive when we are not able to be there.","interaction":"We are a family of three living upstairs (with a cat who is not allowed into the rental apartment), so while we are of course busy with our daily routine, please don’t hesitate to contact us by phone, text, or e-mail if there are any problems, items missing, or other questions.

Even though it's on street level, the street is a quiet / residential one, and the entrance is some distance from the sidewalk—so noise is not an issue. There are very nice restaurants and cafes less than a block or two away. Ildiko went the extra mile in stocking the apartment with essential items, including a fully stocked first-aid kit(!). Although I had office space in Manhattan, I spent all of my time working from home, because I didn't want to leave the house or this neighborhood.

The accommodation is spacious and clean, the water pressure in the shower is good and strong, and the outdoor space is a big plus.  Even though the apartment faces the street, it is very quiet, and the neighborhood is great.  Plenty of shops and restaurants, and just 4 short blocks to the subway.  The only drawback would be the lack of cable and a radio or cd player.  But really, this is NY - there's not much time for tv.

The apartment itself is wonderful, with a very spacey kitchen. And it offers access to outdoor space which is great in summer. I will definitely recommend Ildiko‘s place to my next visitors!!!"},{"_id":"257047792","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1524542400000"}},"listing_id":"10573225","reviewer_id":"179759870","reviewer_name":"Jp","comments":"I had such a wonderful stay at Ildiko's place...I would gladly stay here again and readily recommend the apartment to other AirBnBrs.

The apartment is close to the F subway line as well as Prospect Park.

There is a lovely garden in the back which we were told we could use but it was really hot when we were there so we didn't take advantage of that (but it looked really nice and peaceful). For location, you can't get much better than Park Slope! It's just a few blocks from the F/G or a short walk to the R line. There are tons of restaurants and shops nearby and it's a 5-10 minute walk to Prospect Park. This space is so inviting and comfortable, it was the perfect place to come back to at the end of a busy day touring the city. And you can't beat the price!

Idilko is friendly, communicative and helpful, and the apartment has a great selection of maps for exploring the area, books and music for R&R.

Once booked, he kept in content with myself as well as my girlfriend. He responded very quickly and answered all the questions we had. A week or so before our stay, Andrei sent us a video of the place explaining the room as well as to where things were (like a virtual tour) which was very helpful to us. The day we arrived, the drive up is about 7-8 minutes from the bottom. Our informant was Maria who met us there with the keys and instructions. The place was smaller than we imagined but it was to our liking. Well stocked for the kitchen as in utensils and pots and pans as well as a beautiful bathroom. It is a very quiet neighborhood so if you're not quiet, I suggest not staying here. The other tenants are in close quarters to your studio so be considerate and don't make so much noise. Overall, our stay was great. The view was beautiful and had a great scene of diamond head. We would recommend this place. If anyone ever needs anything during their stay, ask Andrei and he would be more than happy to accommodate you!!"},{"_id":"63408803","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1456117200000"}},"listing_id":"10578580","reviewer_id":"23857391","reviewer_name":"Edison","comments":"Andrei had alot of questions at the beginning, it showed how strict he screens his potential guests.\n\nA video was provided before arrival, it was very helpful and showed exactly what the place looks like.\n\nWe were lucky enough that the host organised pick up from the airport.

Bathroom was super clean and the stone shower and path was so cute. We loved the outdoor patio as well, not only to enjoy the view but to eat there was convenient and pretty as well. During our stay in late may / early June, which was apparently the rainy season, since Andrei's place is uphill in the mountains, it seemed always rainy or drizzling, but don't be too concerned or deceived because when you drive out of the neighborhood, it's super clear and sunny.

The patio was also really nice and wished we could have used it more (but of course, we were out and about doing other things).

We were greeted by Mariya upon arrival, and she was great. She walked us in, showed us how to work a few things and gave us the keys.  \r\n\r\nThe studio is beautiful. Perfect for two people. The shower at the end of everyday was amazing. We loved the finishes throughout the space- beautiful wood cabinetry, the countertops, appliances, and the bathroom was perfect. The bed was very comfortable- just bring extra pillows if you sleep with more than one per person. \r\n\r\nThe outdoor living space provided absolutely stunning views over the ocean and diamond head. There was comfortable furniture, space to hang drying towels and even a sink outside. The flowering trees next to the porch were also lovely. \r\n\r\nThe kitchen was very useful. When we arrived, Mariya mentioned that there might be roaches (they do spray the apartment regularly, and there was spray under the sink). The presence of these bugs is not due to a lack of cleanliness- just a consequence of location on a tropical island. We had 6 unwelcome guests during the 8 days, but we were able to get rid of them quickly. This is not a criticism of the apartment or cleaning- but just something to be mindful of anywhere on Oahu. \r\n\r\nI would absolutely stay here again if I returned to the island, and highly recommend this studio. If you have a rental car, there is nowhere on the island you would visit that would take much longer than an hour. We were able to go all over the island without any trouble, and had an amazing time. \r\n\r\nMany thanks to Andrei and Mariya for their help and for the opportunity.

The studio's lanai is super-nice and on clear days, the view towards Diamond Head is priceless! Overall, the studio was clean, is tastefully furnished and although not big, it is still a good fit for a couple.\nUnfortunately, there was also some construction going on in the adjacent appartment, but we were able to clarify this with Andrei. \n\nTwo more things just to be aware of: \n1. The windows are hawaiian-style (as you can see in the pictures), which means you can have a nice breeze (a plus!), but also do not provide a lot of noise isolation if it gets windy outside. It is a quiet neighborhood however. You can also not darken the room a lot, if it matters to you.\n2. For all you coffee-lovers out there, there is no coffee maker available. Instant coffee is provided though.\n\nOverall, we can recommend it and would come back if we were to return to the island.

Location wise it is in a quiet area, outside of the main hustle and bustle of Waikiki but you can easily reach places by car, or catch an uber into town which would cost about $18 dollars each way. It's a good location for getting around the island if you have a car as you can quickly and easily reach the main Highway to go North, East or\nWest. You also have a safe parking space for your car at the Studio. \n\nThe view from the studio is fantastic, especially on an evening. We spent a lot of time at the outside area enjoying the views of Diamond Head and the Ocean. The Studio itself is well equipped; good coffee machine, oven, lots of kitchen equipment, beach towels, toiletries and a great hairdryer. If you're planning to cook any of your own meals during your stay than this Studio is perfect. The studio is quite cosy but we never felt like it was too small, it was perfect for our stay. \n\nThe information we received about the booking was excellent, Andrei sent me a check in video so I could see how everything worked first hand, and an email with clear information. Andrei also very kindly let us drop our luggage off at the studio when we arrived as our flight got in very early, this then allowed us to go off for the day with no hassle and was very much appreciated! \n\nI would highly recommend the studio, I hope to be back!

The suite has  a Keurig coffee machine so don't buy ground coffee like I did!  The kitchen is well equipped.  There were many freezer ice packs and snap lid food containers that we used to pack picnic lunches--bring a cooler bag.   The shower is great!  The only thing you need to understand is that the long term renters' (very nice) kitchen window faces the private lanai, so anything you say or they say can be heard.

It's also well located for trips to Whole Foods, the local restaurants in Kaimuki (best neighborhood in Honolulu, in my opinion), and the beach (about 12 min away).  There's also a fabulous view and plenty of hiking nearby.  What more could you need?\n\nThere can be a bit of noise in the evening, given the proximity to the neighbors, but it's pretty common in Hawaii!  \n\nAndrei was communicative and responsive to all my needs.\n\nI would recommend this place to get away from the crowds of Waikiki and get a sense for the real Hawaii lifestyle.\n"},{"_id":"167124094","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1499227200000"}},"listing_id":"10578580","reviewer_id":"49373804","reviewer_name":"David","comments":"Second time staying here and was just as perfect as the first!

The space was very inviting, clean, and relaxing. We had a lot of privacy despite being in close proximity with the other residents. The balcony was perfect! Especially the view when you first wake up in the morning. Location wise; a lot of places were very accessible via car, we were basically in the middle of everything. Checking in and out was a breeze, and Jhanna/Andrei were easy to reach. Staying here gave us the experience of a true local in Oahu.

Als wir ankamen, konnten wir nicht fassen wie wunderschön die Aussicht auf den Diamond Head war. Das Apartment ist klein aber fein und alles wichtige war vorhanden. Einige Gläser, Pfannen, Geschirr etc. Spülmittel, Zewatücher, Toilettenpapier, frische Handtücher. Es war alles wunderbar sauber.\nDer Check-in war auch sehr einfach. Jhanna und Andrei sind ein super Team. Wir hatten Kontakt über eine Whatappgruppe, in der alle Fragen auch geklärt werden konnten. Bei Problemen konnte man Jahanna direkt kontaktieren und sie wäre sofort zur Stelle.\nFür Sicherheit ist auch gesorgt mit Sicherheitspins am Tor und am Apartment.\nAndrei macht darauf aufmerksam, dass es sich um Hawaiianische Fenster handelt, was sehr wichtig ist. Wer keine hellhörige Orte mag, sollte das Apartment meiden. Uns hat es super gefallen, da wir auf der Suche nach Ruhe waren. Es war perfekt!\nWas noch wichtig zu erwähnen ist: die perfekte Aussicht hat auch ihren Preis! Es geht halt logischer Weise sehr steil hoch. Zu Fuß würde ich persönlich nicht empfehlen. Mit einem Auto ist alles kein Problem! Eine Buslinie fährt auch regelmäßig vorbei. \nUns ist halt die Hygiene sehr wichtig und das Apartment war sehr sehr sauber! Wenn wir nach Hawaii nochmal kommen, werden wir aufjedenfall bei Andrei und Jhanna wieder buchen.\nDanke für diese unvergessliche Zeit!"},{"_id":"188839139","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1504065600000"}},"listing_id":"10578580","reviewer_id":"130882934","reviewer_name":"Bob","comments":"This is a very nicely appointed studio with a beautiful view of Diamond Head and the Pacific from the lanai.

A 5 minute drive down the hill takes you to HI 1 and from there literally everywhere you want to go to discover the island. Don't forget the Diamond Head Hike which is almost right at your doorstep.

Kitchen is luxerious but also small, things like a toaster are missing, everything only the minimum, 4 plates , 4 knifes, 4 forks, 4 cups some of them partly broken. The bed very small and dated. Highlight is the bathroom, very nice.\nAs described place has only hawain windows no curtains so if you either need a rather dark lace to sleep or if the neighbors have a party (the bed is just next to the barbeque of the other tenants) you can imagine that it is not easy to sleep.\n\nPatio: Wunderful view. Furniture dirty and dated. Partly not cleaned. \n\nAll of the above you may like or not however what we did not like at all was the existence of giant cockroaches  in the kitchen and the habits of the so called „host“ how just replied that cockroaches are normal and that he informed about this.\n\nI assume he will reply to our review that everything what we say is nonsense and he is right....\n\nWe like airbnb but this place where it all about making money.

I read every single review that people had posted and was a bit skeptical on how things would turn out to be. Most noted from what I’ve read from others but disagree with are 1) bugs: bugs were never an issue and we often left the door open. Occasionally a moth or two would show up but we never saw any ants or roaches or anything based on what I’ve read. 2) the view: the view was incredible and waking up to the ocean every morning and going out onto the patio to have a coffee was a very romantic touch for my fiancé and I.\n\nThe only thing I would say is that if you are looking at spreading out and enjoy the luxury of having a lot of added space just verify that this place suits your needs. \n\nJhanna the host does a great job at communicating and is readily available for any and all needs. I felt very pampered every step of the way and truly enjoyed staying there as a result from her great hospitality. \n\nThank you for having us.

The checkin process was easy and the parking on premises was great. The location of the airbnb was beautiful! It was located up in the hills. Luckily we had a rental car to get around, without a car, the location can be far from the beach, food, stores, etc. The place itself was clean, slightly smaller than expected, but sufficient space for 2 guests. I was worried about insects but luckily had no encounter with bugs.  We made sure to keep the area clean and not leave any food around. The view from the patio was spectacular and we enjoyed having breakfast there every morning. The guesthouse is located beside other homes so at times it could be a little noisy, but overall not a huge concern for us. Andrei was kind enough to allow us to have a late checkout which we really appreciated as our flight was in the evening. It was very easy to get a hold of the hosts.

The view can't be beat for that price, the bed was super cozy, and the water pressure in the spacious shower was really nice. The apartment is situated between a neighbor's home and another tenant. The tenants are quiet and neighbors came and went during our stay but note - with proximity to their place you can hear them talking pretty clearly if that bothers you. The neighbors also installed motion detector lights that are just outside the studio windows across from the bed. They were on all night (probably due to wind and trees). Andrei provides blankets to cover the windows, but it does not really block the light. If you are a light sleeper, bring a sleep mask. Be sure to clear any food and keep doors closed unless you want to see a visitor ;) We didn't see any until the last evening, but the biggest cockroach I've ever seen still startled me (I'm a spazz). The studio is treated, but the tropics can bring in some creepy crawlers. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the cozy studio. The porch is a gorgeous spot in the morning to enjoy your coffee and watch birds in the neighbors' yard."}]}

I have informed the householder at once. When we arrived at the airport, we could not find the driver waiting for us at the arrival with our name. Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n "},{"_id":"86425734","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1468641600000"}},"listing_id":"10581101","reviewer_id":"47750495","reviewer_name":"Glen","comments":"The apartment has a good location convenient to metro and walking distance to Sagrada Familia and many good eating options.

Please note that one of the double beds is smaller than usual, so only recommended for one single person or a couple very much in love! The bathrooms were not very well equipped, there was no soap and only few toalet paper, but upon request Regina's staff brought us some. We did not use the kitchen that much. As we were a group of friends we did not like that all beds had double sheets. Unfortunately at checking in we had to wait approximately 1 hour for the lady with the keys, which was not a very good beginning. \nThe location of the apartment is not very central, we did not use public transportation, so it is a 35 minutes walk from the center. The closest metro station we have used once is also 10 minutes walk away.

We didn't meet Mathieu however he was accessible by message/phone and responded quickly, even booking a taxi to the airport for us. \nWe used 2 of the 3 bedrooms and found the beds comfortable. Only 1 bedroom has external windows. The bathroom floor area is very small although the shower which is over a bath was roomy and had hot powerful water. Kitchen is roomy for cooking and has microwave, stove top and oven however the eating table is small and would struggle to seat more than 2 or 3.\nExcellent new washing machine.  \nUnfortunately the wooden stairs for entering the building and to the apartments mean it is noisy when people are coming and going and you could hear the people in the apartment above  walking around. Maybe an issue for light sleepers.\nThe apartments front rooms (lounge and a bedroom) have a bit of a view through to the river and to buildings in the distance which was nice especially at night seeing the lights.

It is a large flat right located in the centre of Porto, up a very steep cobbled street adding to the historical feel of Porto. The historic part of Porto is made up of a number of steep hills, mainly cobbled. The Douro river is just down the road from the flat, together with the majority of the main attractions in Porto. \nThe flat is quite cosy, with antique furniture, adding to the charm of the area. The flat has all the amenities as listed. The only issue for us I would say is that is no TV, but if this is not a necessity, then there is no issue.\nMatthieu is super nice, helpful & responsive. He has placed a number of maps and information in the flat to help you get around. Matthieu was always available whenever we called or messaged and was super helpful. All in all, I would say this is a good choice."},{"_id":"260045520","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1525320000000"}},"listing_id":"10628126","reviewer_id":"3594109","reviewer_name":"Leslie","comments":"I highly recommend staying in Mathieu's place.

The old town where the apartment is , is a great place to explore but it’s really worth venturing elsewhere also and the buses are good and easy to use. We went to the beaches several times using the 500 bus. The flat itself is a perfect size for 6 people and there is a bed settee I believe but we didn’t use it. I think more than 6 would be overcrowded. Every thing we needed was provided. We didn’t need to ask Mathieu for any changes but he was very approachable and friendly and I am certain he would sort any problems out quickly.

Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela atenção!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n“This apartment is in the most amazing location.

The place is cozy and immaculate. Other than the bed being a bit stiff, I loved being in the apartment. The water was hot, the wi-fi worked perfectly. The only negative that I had about the room was the noise. \r\n\r\nThe unit is situated on the 2nd floor of the building right outside a busy street. Every night around midnight, two bars would open up across the and start blaring music. The music would not stop until 8am the next morning. I ended up having to buy a white noise machine just to last through the night.\r\n\r\nThe only other feedback I had was around Fabio, the host. All of the reviews mentioned how responsive and helpful he was. However that was not the case for me. The day I booked, I couldn't get him to respond to the booking. I even had to have AirBnB call him. And then I asked him about touring the city. Instead of offering, he pointed me to a few self serve options. When I asked again, he said he would plan a trip then never responded. When I responded to him, he said he was too busy and my trip was over. \r\n\r\nFabio being my tour guide is not a huge requirement, but I had thought he would be more willing (or suggest someone), given the feedback people had for him o this site.\r\n\r\nAll in all, great place if you don't mind the noise and don't need a helpful host.

Fabio was understanding about our delay but we were a bit embarassed that we had kept him waiting.  The apartment was  centrally located (within walking distance to the beach), clean, modern, and compact with 24 hour security.  We don't speak any Portugese but Fabio was able to communicate with us in English and was extremely helpful in providing all relavant information including a map.  He suggested restaurants, how to purchase tickets for tourist attractions and marked most things out on the map.  He also suggested visiting the hippy markets that are open on Sundays - which we really enjoyed.  Fabio was a wonderful, helpful host and it was obvious he wanted us to enjoy his apartment and our trip to Rio.  Only bug bear was spare towels (ie none are provided).  Our bath towels got wet after the 1st day and although we hung them out to dry on the balcony - they didn't really get dry.  I think the problem was a little to do with us - we had just finished a cruise and linen was plentiful so we became a little spoilt - anyway we adjusted our routine (used the hand towels) so it wasn't a major problem.  Rio was fantastic, a really interesting place to visit.  I am sure anyone wishing to go to the Olympics stay at Fabio's - he is very helpful.  He arranged our transport getting back to the airport which worked out perfectly.  Thanks Fabio for the wonderful stay - love love loved it!

We never stop living and learning, and whatever you are planning on doing in Rio de Janeiro, you will continue on this path with an open mind in Rio, and add an important chapter to your personal travel memoire, just by absorbing a few of the experiences Rio has on offer. I have travelled most of the world, and still come alive to the sounds of the different rhythms, love the extraordinary food, and the warmth of the local \"cariocas\". I would say my favorite film so far this year is Intouchables.

The room is very very nice and the property is super cool. The donkey, Mocha, is fun to see work his magic and the house puppy is really cute. Meanwhile, Sherry is a great host who gave me a very thorough intro to organic farming and a lot of encouragement to get starred myself. Highly recommend this place.

If you are an animal lover, this is the place to go.  It's a bit remote (bring a prepared dinner with you because you won't want to leave once you're there), but the upstairs room is so wonderful to be in, three sides with windows that look out into the garden and the palm trees.  It has a real tree house feel to it.  Sherrie showed me how to feed papaya peels to the donkey, and Mr. Chris, the cat, bounded in the door when I opened it and spent the nights with me on the king-size bed, which was a treat for me.

But the second person in our party used earplugs provided by Sherri. So it depends on you if this is pros or cons.\n\nNeed to mention: the road is unpaved. We rented SUV, so no problems at all.

Sherri is a true artist, her art is everywhere around the property from the floor to the ceilings and outside.  Everything is so pretty and dream-like so \"Enchanted gardens\" is fitting. Little touches throughout the home really tie everything together. the property is somewhat remote but only a short drive to town, the beach, and Volcano national park. You get the perks of being surrounded in rainforest and privacy but still get convenience, wifi, and hot water. \nSherri was so helpful with anything we needed; she shared her art supplies with me and loaned us snorkel equipment and pool noodles after telling us the best spots on the island. \nSherri and the animals were all sweet hearts. My favorite was the lovable pup, the friendly donkey and the happy chickens walking about the yard. She provided fresh fruit daily and offered us any fruit growing on the property. She even gave me a beautiful bouquet to take home with me. It was wonderful! \nMy fiancé and I decided to get married on the big island, and we TRULY could not have had a better time or stayed anywhere better. Great for couples who want to adventure but have somewhere beautiful to come home to!

I love the arts and have a background in theatre and music- and an interest in writing poetry. Although I dont drink or party, I am known to work it out on the dance floor! I talk on the phone a lot and am a morning gym person.\n\nI grew up in the midwest and have lived in NYC for about 13 years. Ive been in my current (3 bedroom) apartment for about 12 years and have been doing airbnb for about half of that time! I am in my mid 30's, I work from home and enjoy a friendly, clean, peaceful environment.\n\nIf im home, Im often working in my room/home office. From time to time i host small meetings in my room or living room. Guests are welcome to come and go as they please. Since i have 2 rooms on airbnb i just ask folks to be mindful of other people, shared bathroom and kitchen, etc.  Although i dont normally get to spend a lot of time with guests, I truly enjoy meeting new people and it means so much to me for people to enjoy my home. Given the high rate of gentrification where i live, im also happy to share more about local businesses to support that invest in families who have historically lived in this neighborhood.

It's very much an interior room, not just by a hall and a living room, but also by a staircase, the bathroom and the kitchen. It's in the center of the apartment. The openings are sheet rocked in, so have no insulation. There is no separation from the owner's unit downstairs. What this means is that sound (all sounds, casual sounds, everything)  is completely transparent within the room. I would not recommend for a light sleeper, or for someone who needs to feel a sense of privacy. \r\nI also wrote up front about what I needed. I didn't feel listened to at all. Then I was blamed being for not being up front (apparently because I didn't emphasize that I seriously needed what I needed), and then was also told when I was angry that my communication style is overwhelming. It actually made me feel pretty \"gas lighted.\"\r\nFinally, the apartment is extremely expensive even by NYC standards. My friends who visited me during my month long stay were aghast. They felt that what I was paying for the room was close to what the rent probably was for the whole apartment.\r\n...On the up-side the place is clean, and the neighborhood is great. The landlord downstairs is very nice too. For a few days of visiting if you're not noise sensitive, the apartment could be quite fine if you don't mind the price.

We had everything we needed. Bed was very comfy, we had also plenty of space for our stuff - pretty big closet and chest of drawers. Living room and kitchen were available all the time.

Her place was a home away from home. I especially loved the bed and the fact that the room had a huge closet, for NYC standards, of course. I was also able to use her kitchen, and she left space for me to put some things in the fridge, which was so nice. The location of her place was also great. Crown Heights is an amazing neighborhood, and her place was just a few blocks from the 2/3/4/5 trains. Overall, I loved my stay and highly recommend Rachael's place!

What started as a coffee plantation in the mid-1800s is now the largest planned development on Kauai. Princeville is home to some of the finest resorts, golf courses and restaurants on the islands. Kauai’s north shore is also where you’ll find some of the most spectacular scenery in Hawaii. There are three main beaches in Princeville, which are Kenomene Beach, Kaweonui Beach and Puu Poa Beach. A wide reef along these beaches creates warm pockets for swimming and snorkeling in calm weather. Other area activities include tennis, golf, windsurfing, kayaking, fishing, sailing, helicopter tours and shopping. You can arrange for a private guided jungle hike, waterfall excursion or kayaking adventure. ","notes":"The pool and hot tub are available for your use until 9 pm.

","interaction":"We love meeting our guests and hearing about their lives and other travels, but they are free as well to enjoy as much seclusion and privacy as they wish.","house_rules":"Here are a few things that may be helpful to your stay. Please do not leave fan or lights on when you are not in residence. As in all resorts, no towels on balcony railing but on chairs is fine. Also observe Hawaiian tradition of \"no shoes\" in house. No loud noise or music after 9pm.  Please rinse beach items off after use by patio shower. Please use rags under kitchen or bath sink to clean off Kauai red dirt (not bath or beach towels!). Do not take bath towels to the beach. AT&T phones get poor service here. WiFi available.  Queen's Bath is right across the street. It is a natural volcanic lava pool. Please observe the warning signs at the top of the path. Always keep an eye on the ocean and stay off wet rocks as that means waves have broken over them. Also the path can be slippery when wet.  The pool and hot tub are for your pleasure from 9am - 9pm.  Do not park overnight on the grass. It is against Princeville rules.  Please tell us if you have a concern.

Coral's hot tub was also perfect after a full day of hiking. Coral was extremely helpful, accessible, and thoughtful-she provided macadamia nut candies and water in the place of fruit from her large garden because the fruit was not ripe yet.

The room had a full size refrigerator that allowed us to chill our water for the hike.  We had a large screen TV, wi-fi, microwave oven, toaster and dishes for use in the room.  In addition, we had access to a cooler to take beverages along with us to the beach, a sun umbrella, beach chairs and many other useful items! Coral also offered my wife an awesome walking stick for the hike to the falls.\r\nAfter the long hike, we came back and treated our sore muscles to the jacuzzi.  There is also a grill if you feel inclined to cook in the courtyard.  \r\nLast, parking was free, and there is direct access (across the street) to Queens Bath which is incredible in the summertime.  \r\n\r\nBe sure to also ask about where to sit back and watch the sunset from the cliff overlooking Queen's bath just a short 2 minute walk from the room.\r\n"},{"_id":"40433082","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1438315200000"}},"listing_id":"1069531","reviewer_id":"1775906","reviewer_name":"Bunny","comments":"Our hosts were very welcoming and generous with their home!

When booking, I knew we would be close to Queen's Bath but didn't realize that we would be at such an awesome location for sunsets.  The neighborhood was very quiet in the evenings and this is probably the only place we have ever stayed in Kauai that we didn't get woken up by roosters.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in the Garden Room, which got pretty toasty in the evenings with the west sun coming in.

The house location is outside of the 4G networks so communication with the outside is frustrating. While access to Queen's Bath is across the street,  it's a treacherous and muddy hike down the steep slopes without safety provisions.

We really wanted to see and experience Kauai the best we could. When we saw Coral's ad on Airbnb we knew it would fit all of our wants and needs. Upon arriving, we were welcomed by her husband Ian who took us around their beautiful property. Location is a huge plus with this hidden gem, it is only steps away from Queen's bath and a short 5 minute ride from Hanalei, which we frequented. The pool was beautiful, even though we only used it once. Coral does a great job in making sure her guests are comfortable. Her hospitality is in a league of it's own from offering fresh fruit she grew herself to local insights on what to do and where to go. We stayed in Princeville just before their winter months. It was mostly on the windier side, but it did not inhibit our travels. The only one  recommendation we have is if you decide to take a boat tour to the Na Pali Coast to see the open-ceiling caves, go during the summer or when the swells are below 4ft. Whale season is just starting at the end of October, so keep that in mind too if you do decide to take a boat tour. Otherwise, here are our top 5 picks picks Kauai: 1. Kalalau Trail (bring shoes with traction!), 2. Ishihara Market for Poke (see Waimea Canyon same day), 3. Lawai Beach for Snorkeling (next to The Beach House), 4. Queen's Bath (sunny and low swells), 5. Kilauea Town (bakery, juice bar, lighthouse lookout). Enjoy your stay in Kauai! Mahalo!

The property was great; we loved the pool and hot tub in the beautiful courtyard. But the room itself was perhaps the dirtiest Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The bathroom rug was badly stained, the fan was filthy, the walls all need a scrubbing and perhaps repainting. If you're not bothered by cleanliness issues, then you'll probably like this place a lot. \n\nAs far as location, Queen's Bath and Hideaways beach are both awesome destinations within walking distance (and both have parking challenges, so walking is a big advantage). Be aware that a lot of the most popular tourist destinations/activities are far away, especially with part of the North Shore currently closed. Waimea Canyon is two hours away; most tours like flying and ziplining are 45+ minutes. The nearby grocery store (Princeville Foodland) is the most expensive place on the island so stock up on groceries closer to the airport."},{"_id":"331486248","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1538452800000"}},"listing_id":"1069531","reviewer_id":"1429129","reviewer_name":"Rick","comments":"This is an inexpensive place in a million dollar location.

The host, Coral, and husband Ian are very friendly and gracious.  But they stay out of your way if you prefer privacy.  The grounds of this huge house are similar to an arboretum.  The en-suite bathroom and kitchen area are immaculate showing the care of a cleaner with very high standards.

Corals husband also gave us some great tips about local gems to visit. There are a few different rooms available. My friend and I stayed in a more modest room but it had everything we needed and we were comfortable. We spent most of our time outside on the property or exploring the island so a simple room was perfect, especially on a budget.  It can be warm at night but the fan works well. I struggled a lot with the WiFi and had no cell phone service. I’m sure Coral would have reset the WiFi if we asked but for me it wasn’t necessary and I enjoyed being “unplugged” so to speak. My friend was able to get WiFi on her laptop, we just couldn’t get it on our phones for something reason. Overall this was a wonderful vacation spot!!

My wife and I thought we took a wrong turn...  We didn't.  It's very very nice.  The value I was getting increased 2-fold when we pulled into the location.  \n\nCoral got me an amazing deal on a rental car.  We do not require much, and our car wasn't much.  But, it had 4 tires, A/C, great gas mileage, and pick up from the airport.  If you just need a basic car, do not go to the rental places at the airport.  Talk to Coral.\n\nThe room was what we saw on the site.  It's clean, comfortable, and is set up for you to enjoy a quick, small meal at \"home\" when you want to save some money or enjoy your own cooking.  There is ground coffee and a machine which we used every day.  Refrigerator, plates, utensils, blender (Yes, I made Pina Coladas in our room), microwave and hot plate.  Everything you need.\n\n The rainy nights were an absolute joy.  Hearing the rain on the big leafy bush in the front window was relaxing and gave that extra atmosphere of being away and relaxed.\n\nThe grounds of Asia House are amazing and welcoming.  You will love your stay here.  \n\nMy only suggestion would be a ceiling fan.  The fan provided is adequate.  Our last day was the most humid.  My wife and just sat in front of the fan to get relief.  A ceiling fan would be amazing.  However, this does not change the fact that if we go back to Kauai, we are staying at Asia House.  It's a real gem.  I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone."},{"_id":"345341953","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1541304000000"}},"listing_id":"1069531","reviewer_id":"2230198","reviewer_name":"Mariana","comments":"Coral and Ian's home is a spectacular sight to see from outside and inside, their garden is impeccable and the neighboring homes in the area are also beautiful. Surrounded by the quiet golf course, this neighborhood is an escape from the beaten path, but also a stone's throw (quite literally) to the famous Queen's Bath hiking trail. We stayed in the lovely garden studio which was private and quiet. They supplied us with all the necessities we needed for a comfortable stay, fruits from their garden, coffee and condiments, and a nice sized fridge in the room. An indoor shower in our room as well as an outdoor shower to clean off the unavoidable mud from adventuring! We are so grateful to have had this quiet landing pad after long excursions with a firm bed to come home to. They have tips for staying cool and a fan in the room. We got to see lots of cute geckos climbing outside and explore garden critters and kitty cats.

The Gaudi Guell Park is an uphill walk of about 900 meters.  Our room and bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable for our family of three.  The internet worked well and her rooftop terrace was pleasant for afternoon tea and breakfast.  In fact, Nuria offered us tea on the roof upon our arrival.  We enjoyed having use of the kitchen during our stay.  The elevator in her building was nice for carrying luggage up and down.  Our Spanish and Nuria’s English were minimal, but we were able to communicate.  This is certainly not a luxurious place, but good for those traveling within a budget.

Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until 10pm, but I was able to notify her through (Hidden by Airbnb) just before we took off and she was fine about it. She  has a small VW Pollo which we just managed to fit all 3 of our big bags in to, plus us 3 and Nuria! She pointed out the closest metro station (Lesseps) on the way to her house and made us tea on the Terrace upon arrival to her home. She doesn't speak English so we communicated in Spanish. The room was fine for us, a very narrow apartment, as are most apartments in Barcelona. A small lift was good to take our luggage up as the apartment is the top of 6 or so levels. We had a fan in our room and a big open window which was great as it was hot! Shower is either hot or cold and bathroom shared with another guest room. Towels provided. Showers between 7:00 and 22:00 as bathroom is inbetween the 2 guest rooms and that rule is to help keep noise levels to a minimum for any guests who might prefer to sleep from 10pm. Approx 15 mins walk to Park Guell which was great! And about 25 mins walk to La Sagrada Familia. A really great fruit/vegetable/organic produce with the best of everything just a few streets away. Access to fridge available on request. Access to cutlery, crockery and microwave (not oven or stove). Great strong wifi connection. A few barking dogs in the neighborhood, but otherwise quiet. Nuria kindly offered for us to leave our luggage for the day as we were checking out, but we didn't need to. Nuria seemed to do a bit of work from home, she kept out of our way, but was around if we had needed to ask her anything. Over all our stay was good.

Pleasant walks to Park Güell and Sagrada Familia. We got to the Cathedral via metro no problem, and my friend and I are no experts at public transportation. If we can figure it out, anyone can. The wifi didn't work for us but we didn't really need it for such a short stay and it was no problem, we didn't even mention it (we think it might have been our phones). We stayed for 2 whole days and 3 nights, and we saw everything we wanted to see. Would recommend for a short trip where you don't mind feeling like you're at sleep away camp with your bunkmates.

So if you want to leave your valuables you not only have to trust Nuria (which I would) but also all the other guests. You also share the bathroom with the other room, (so up to six people). And there is no kitchen. Just a mini fridge and a microwave (that doesn't work very well in the hall) the location was good and the other guests and Nuria were very nice, we actually stayed an extra night. But don't expect luxury. I feel bad leaving a mediocre review because Nuria was very friendly but the room was bare minimum for us.

There is also a supermarket and shops nearby, which make it easy to get provisions. Of course, the house has Wifi connection, which is fast and reliable.\r\nThis has been the first time I book a room through Airbnb and it has been such a fantastic experience that I will definitely consider Airbnb for further stays, and if in Sydney, at Natasa’s place for sure!\r\n"},{"_id":"4649523","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1368849600000"}},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"299218","reviewer_name":"Sarah","comments":"Natasa is an incredibly lovely person and an amazing host!

Even though the station is so close, you can't hear the trains from the room, so a good night's sleep is guaranteed. The room itself is very big and gorgeous! Natasa really has an eye for decorating and designed the room to be not only beautiful but very functional! There is tons of storage space, including two locking bedside cabinets. The kitchen is also wonderful and Natasa was kind enough to let us use a shelf in the pantry and another in the fridge. We loved staying here so much and were so sad to leave!

Natasa is very welcoming, and she made me feel right at home from the moment I got there.  She is generous and flexible--and one of the happiest people to be around.  Natasa always had the perfect suggestion of where to go, what to do or the best way to get there.  She knows the city really well, and is always happy to give suggestions (or show you herself!).  Natasa will talk with you as much or as little as you want, but we had a great time hanging out downstairs--I never felt like I needed to be in my room.  She even invited me to her famous pizza night with her friends--yum!\r\n\r\nAs for the house/room--it was great.  The location is amazing--so close to both the Petersham train station and a short walk to all of the Parramatta Rd buses.  Everything you need will be close by or short walk away.  The house is great--clean, homely and has everything you need! The green room was perfect--great hard wood floors, comfortable bed, plenty of space for my things--as advertised.  Even with 3 or 4 of us in the house, I never had to wait for the bathroom--everyone had such different schedules that it always seemed to work out.  I did laundry quite a few times while I was there, which was no problem at all--there is a dryer or clothes line.  \r\n\r\nI would not hesitate for a second to book this house again!

I was looking for somewhere chilled out to stay while I settled into my new job and Natasa's was perfect. Natasa is s great host, she is welcoming and friendly but at the same time gives you privacy. She knows so much about Sydney and will give lots of advice from anything from restaurants to transportation. I really enjoyed my time staying at Natasa's and definitely recommend for a great base for exploring Sydney."},{"_id":"59191852","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1452229200000"}},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"33036574","reviewer_name":"Monika","comments":"My daughter and I enjoyed our stay at Natasa´s house very much. Everything was like in the description. The house was very charming and the central of the City as well as the Airport was easily to reach by train, which stopped just around the Corner. Besides that we had good luck that Natasa was at home. So we could talk with her  several times, which was just so nice and much fun. She also gave us helpful ideas about restaurants or where to spend New Year´s Eve and so on. We would like to stay there again any time."},{"_id":"61499662","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1454648400000"}},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"42115634","reviewer_name":"Amin","comments":"I booked the room from my account for one of my friends and this is his view: \r\nActually, I was lucky that I spent my first days in Sydney in Natasa' lovely house. I spent more than two weeks there. As other people here mentioned, you feel that you are in your own house and have freedom for yourself. Alot of movies are provided in living room that you can select among them and watch. Also you can enjoy the lovely kitchen and the terrace. Being completely close to trian station, it is perfect for new arrivals like me. Also, the area is completely close to city center. When Natasa is at home you can enjoy talking with her. Unfortunately, we could not see each other so much since most of that time she was on a business trip. However among afew talks that we had, I enjoyed her manner and kindness. Beside your room, there are two other bedrooms in the first floor that you should share bathroom with them. It was ok and we had no problem. Also because the weather at most time was mild, the lack of airconditioning did not cause a problem. \r\nFinally, thanks again Natasa"},{"_id":"64101106","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1456722000000"}},"listing_id":"1073607","reviewer_id":"2361683","reviewer_name":"Aurélie","comments":"I couldn't have dreamed of a better place for my stay in Sydney.

(I should actually say even before I arrived since she was extremely flexible and allowed me to alter my stay to a couple days later). My entire stay was extremely comfortable. Natasa gives the perfect balance of privacy and companionship to her guests. She never once disturbed me, but was always willing to have a chat on the rare occasion that we crossed paths (we both were in and out of the house quite often). Any time I was unsure of something she was available by text and always had a quick response. The location is also extremely convenient as it is only about a block from the Petersham station where I was able to catch either the bus or train to wherever I needed to go. You can take the bus to a grocery store, but Norton Plaza has 2 grocers as well as other little shops, and is only about a 10min walk.

Sempre que precisei ela foi rápida em responder e esclareceu todas as dúvidas.\nLocalização: A casa fica ao lado da estação de Trem, literalmente, o que facilita muito os deslocamentos. Fica também relativamente próxima ao aeroporto, inclusive vale a pena usar o Uber se estiver com malas maiores ou em mais de uma pessoa, porque o Trem partindo do Aeroporto tem uma preço diferenciado e pode acabar não valendo a pena.\nQuarto: Amplo, limpo, tem ar-condicionado, guarda roupas, cômoda, além disso colchão e roupa de cama são bons! \nBanheiro: Grande, chuveiro bom. É compartilhado com mais dois quartos (que quando fui estavam ocupados) mas não tivemos problemas. Sempre limpo nos dias que estive aqui. \nCozinha: Bem equipada e pode ser usada sempre que necessário. \nAnfitriã: Natasa foi uma excelente anfitriã!

Just out of sight is one of the most attractive parts of Istanbul. After a couple of minutes’ walk from Taksim, its arrival is heralded by a great old-fashioned Istanbul patisserie, Savoy. Across the street and down the stairs is Otto, a fashionable café/bar in a shady tree-filled courtyard. A little further along is Pilot, a pioneering contemporary art space housed in a converted 1970s nightclub. Opposite is a square with the pastel-green Firuz Ağa Mosque and a few cafés that are always busy, including two where you strictly drink tea, lovingly known to the locals as the Cihangir çay bahçesi. Also try Firuz and Kardeşler Kebap. Opposite these, you’ll find a branch of Selim Usta’s Tarihi Sultanahmet Köftecisi, an Old City institution.

Paid parking is easy to find just right outside the building and free on the weekend which is a plus. I didn't get to meet Maribel but she was extremely responsive with her communication. On the day of check in, Boris was so kind and he ensured we were able to find the flat and even waited outside the building for us (as the Airbnb direction was incorrect- please be sure to use the address provided by your host). Boris provided suggestions on where to go and places to eat. While there is no washer in the unit, overall a wonderful stay in magical Porto. Btw, there is a really delicious sandwich shop around the neighborhood that serves up cheap but yummy pork sandwiches right by the park. You won't miss it as there's always a long line.

Me alojé en el apartamento de Gabriela pues queda muy cerca del mismo (5-7 minutos paseando). \r\n\r\n¿Cómo son las habitaciones?:\r\nLa habitación principal da a un patio interior de la comunidad, es muy tranquila, se oye un poco la maquinaria del ascensor por el día porque está cerca, pero por la noche es silenciosa ya que el edificio es de ambiente familiar, acogedor y se respeta el descanso nocturno. De cualquier modo la zona es tranquila, y de noche mucho más. No hay ruido de tráfico ni nada por el estilo. Yo descansé muy bien.\r\nLa habitación pequeña en realidad es un espacio semiabierto que se comunica con el salón. Y da a la terraza principal. Suuuuper tranquila.\r\n\r\nPositivos:\r\n- El apartamento es un sobreático así que no hay vecinos en esa planta, sólo tú. La terraza es increíble, vistas maravillosas sobre los tejados y colinas al atardecer. En mi caso era casi octubre y ya refrescaba por la noche pero me imaginé que en verano se estaría muy bien cenando allí mismo. \r\n- El Aire Acondicionado funciona perfectamente, de maravilla. Y lo hay en todas las estancias. ¡De lujo!\r\n- WIFI disponible.\r\n- El piso está nuevo y muy limpio. Las fotos se corresponden con la realidad. No hay sorpresas. Decorado sin artificios. Básico pero funcional.\r\n- Farmacia y supermercado en la misma calle, así como papelería y varios bares y cafeterías. \r\n- Boca de metro a escasos metros.\r\n\r\nPosibles Negativos (según necesidades del viajero):\r\n- El agua caliente de la ducha se agota de allí a un tiempo (calentador) y hay que esperar a que el tanque esté nuevamente caliente. Para mi que viajaba sola, era más que suficiente para una agradable y larga ducha. Para más personas supongo habría que tenerlo en cuenta y programarse. O ser breve (ecofriendly!) De cualquier modo es un aspecto menor.\r\n- El ascensor llega hasta el ático. Para llegar al sobreático hay que subir un pequeño tramo de escaleras. Para mi no supuso ningún problema, ni lo supondrá para cualquier viajero joven y en forma. Pero está bien saberlo en caso de personas con problemas de movilidad o para quienes lleven equipajes muy pesados.\r\n\r\nRealmente no son aspectos negativos sino simplemente a tener en cuenta! Mi estancia fue muy agradable y sin incidencias con una perfecta comunicación con mi anfitrión. Así que recomiendo este apartamento sin dudarlo.\r\n\r\nGracias Gabriela!\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"7870897","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1381118400000"}},"listing_id":"1079887","reviewer_id":"7168610","reviewer_name":"Hale","comments":"We arrived very late in the evening and miguel was so nice and waited for us in the appartment.

We spent several nights overlooking the city while we enjoyed wine and cava! The metro was about 2 minutes away making travel around the city easy. We used the local supermarket and fresh fruit stands for some basic supplies. We ate at a local restaurant and shared a pitcher of sangria. The waitress went out of her way to help us! Everything was really nice. Prior to our trip, Gabriela answered all my emails very promptly. I would definitely rent this apartment again!"},{"_id":"9737193","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1389070800000"}},"listing_id":"1079887","reviewer_id":"9845571","reviewer_name":"Marta","comments":"Estuvimos muy a gusto en el apartamento.

Asunto oli loistava pienelle perheelle ja tarvittaessa siellä olisi mahtunut yöpymään useampikin. Asunto vastasi täysin kuvausta,  tai oli jopa parempi! Kuvat eivät anna oikeutta asunnolle. Asunto on hiljattain remontoitu, todella siisti ja erityismaininta jokaisessa huoneessa erikseen olleesta ilmastointilaitteesta. Tullessamme, asunto oli siivottu todella siistiksi ja tuoksui raikkaalta -melkein kuin olisi tullut hotelliin! Asunto oli myös hyvin rauhallinen, naapureista ei kuulunut mitään ääniä. \r\n\r\nMyös Miguel ja Gabriella toimivat loistavia isäntinä: heidät sai hyvin kiinni ennen matkaa, aiemman check-in ajan sopiminen onnistui ongelmitta, asunnolla oltiin vastaanottamassa meitä hyvissä ajoin, Miguel auttoi meitä kantamaan matkatavaramme asuntoon, ongelmatilanteissa saimme apua muutaman tunnin sisällä ja he jopa lähettivät asunnolle unohtuneet matkatavarat postilla peräämme! \r\n\r\nAsunnon läheisyydestä löytyi metroasema, pieniä kauppoja ja edullisia paikallisten suosimia ravintoloita, joskin niissä ymmärrettiin melko heikosti englantia :). Asunnolta oli jonkin verran matkaa esim. Tripadvisorin suosittelemiin ravintoloihin eixamplessa, mutta metrolla pääsi kulkemaan suht vaivattomasti myös lapsen kanssa.\r\n\r\nAsunto ja isännät olivat siis huippuja! Enempää emme olisi voineet toivoa asunnolta tässä hintaluokassa. Yksi asia, mikä kannattaa kuitenkin huomioida tämän asunnon kohdalla on se, ettei hissillä pääse suoraan asunnon kerrokseen vaan hissiltä tarvitsee nousta vielä yksi kerros ylöspäin portaita pitkin.\r\n\r\nKiitos majoittamisestamme, viihdyimme hyvin asunnossanne!"},{"_id":"37571941","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1436328000000"}},"listing_id":"1079887","reviewer_id":"9918897","reviewer_name":"Gustavo","comments":"Very nice flat.

Miguel met us and explained everything also leaving us a contact number (which we never needed as all worked without fail.) The terrace was wonderful. We did purchase a small lawn chair from a shop across the street to lounge in the sun and left it for future guests to enjoy. Laundry set up is great. Washer is in a small room on the terrace which is also where you hang the clothes for drying. That little hotbox gets the clothes dry in a hurry. \r\nNeighborhood was exactly what we wanted. Good bars, restaurants and markets in the area, so good neighborhood feel away from main tourist streets and crowds. Walk a few blocks to The Bar on Calabria. Outstanding small restaurant with friendly owner and great food well priced.\r\nYou could walk everywhere (we did!), but better to get a metro pass (as we also did) which will get you everywhere. A stop (Entenca) is less than half a block away. We got a ten trip pass which lasted a week. Also, nothing quite like  crowding onto a sweaty subway in July to get to know the locals....\r\nWe highly recommend this apartment as the perfect way to enjoy a stay in Barcelona!"},{"_id":"87917071","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1469160000000"}},"listing_id":"1079887","reviewer_id":"69427964","reviewer_name":"Annick","comments":"L appartement est très bien situé et très joli.

We didn't get to spend much time with him, but he made sure we found the apartment and got situated in our room.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is communal, and quite bohemian. Photographs of gurus and flower child murals decorate the walls. The street seemed to be plucked right out of Amsterdam. Odors abound. \r\n\r\nThe beds are a bit like military cots, and in the summer when we visited, we were hugging our small electric fan whenever we were in the room. If you're adventurous and planning to trek for most of your trip, this probably won't be an issue for you.\r\n\r\nThe hike up a winding staircase to the room might be an issue for some visitors--we were traveling with our three-year-old and our return to our room after long days under the summer sun made us dream of an elevator.\r\nBy the map, the apartment looked like a quick jaunt to the beach, but in reality it was more like a 20 minute walk. I was quite surprised by how expansive Barcelona is. There is plenty of life on the avenues below--a playground for children is located in the middle of a small plaza that offers a number of vegetarian restaurants and bars.\r\n\r\nAccess to La Rambla might be the biggest benefit of this location. It's about a one minute walk to the crowded thoroughfare, and that means you have immediate access to Barcelona's metro, as well as the airport shuttles.\r\n\r\nAnother minor perk worth mentioning: the communal kitchen was stocked with cereals, which I imagine would provide a quick meal to the ultra-budgeted backpacker. It helped us out when wrangling with our picky son, still hungry after a halfhearted pass at tapas and paella.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, Flo's place I think would be best suited to adventurous backpackers and young students, but the price certainly makes it worth considering for small families on a shoestring budget. If you can live without some creature comforts, you'll be happy have this as a crash and launch pad, sweating out the night to the lively ambience of bustling Barcelona below.

The place is a small room located in an apartment complex on the second floor (note: 3 flights of stairs to climb). It has a great, central location, but it feels smaller than what the pictures present and can get pretty cramped with luggages on the floor. The place is mostly clean. With only one desk fan, it can get pretty hot in the summer (mid-July). One of the beds had a overly soft, spongy mattress that was kind of difficult to sleep in, but we managed okay. This is a very minimal room (especially for three people), good for travellers trying to save money without a cheaper option.

Cleaning lady was lovely, and very friendly and helpful whenever I ran into her at the apartment.\r\n\r\nAs others have mentioned, the photos are very deceptive. In reality, the room is like half the size of what the photos implies. And not nearly as light either. The room is poorly ventilated, so quickly becomes musky, when the door and window are shut. The room has a small fan to try and mitigate this, but if the fan is off for any length of time, room quickly becomes musky. Wifi doesn't really work in the room either; have to go into kitchen to get the signal.\r\n\r\nQuite a noisy apartment too. Host's children were around, and making noise often. I.e. One night, two of them were running skateboards and scooters down the tiled corridor at 10 o'clock at night. You could hear the thunderous noise through the whole apartment (and I imagine on the floor below too). So, not ideal if you want to get an early night's sleep and hit the tourist sites very early.

Nothing against the host, it was just the area that's right in the center of everything so it's so loud. The apartment downstairs had a huge party and the whole place was shaking until almost 1 in the morning. There is a window in the room right in the courtyard so everyone talking in other apartments echoes. If noise is not a concern, then this is a great place.

And the main light in our room went out halfway through our stay, leaving us to huddle around a small reading light the rest of the time. Check-in was a little hard to figure out as well, with lots of communication back and forth. The owner, Flo, apparently did not live there. When our light went out we went and knocked on her door, and also when the house ran out of TP, but she never answered. However, if money is a main concern this place fits the bill very well.

So sieht die Wohnung nicht aus. Viel kleiner, als auf den Bildern. Die Ausstattung ist für den Arsch, darauf gehe ich auch noch genauer ein. Der Küchenschrank, war eine Glasvitrine mit paar Gläsern, Tellern und Besteck. Das ist aber gar nicht sooo schlimm, nerviger fand ich es, dass die Ausrüstung zum Kochen miserabel war. Mehr als Nudeln kochen war nicht drinnen... mussten also fast immer draussen essen, das Geld was durch das billige Appartement gespart wurde, ist für das Essen zwischen durch draufgegangen... Waschen kann man seine Kleidung gleich um die Ecke des Appartements. Unser Zimmer hat sehr muffig gestunken, wir hatten zwar einen Ventilator, der allerdings kaum etwas gebracht hat. Es war regelmäßig eine Haushälterin da, die ihren Job auch vernünftig gemacht hat, allerdings war sie nur für Oberflächen zuständig. Das Appartement ist von Grund auf dreckig. In seinem eigenen Zimmer kann man nicht ohne Schuhe oder Hausschuhen herumlaufen, ohne die Füße dreckig zu machen, dasselbe gilt gilt für das Bad. Der Kühlschrank war absolut versifft, wer dort sein Essen gelagert hat, konnte damit rechnen, dass dir Kühlschrankflüssigkeit und Fruchtfliegen darauf zu finden waren. Erst nach dem ich den Host darauf angesprochen habe, (Tag 3) unseres Aufenthalts wollte er sich darum kümmern, Tag 11 von insgesamt 13 Tagen hatte der Host einen neuen Kühlschrank besorgt. Der Haushälterin zur Folge, sei der Kühlschrank schon sehr lange in diesem Zustand gewesen. Der Host war zwar immer zu Hause, da er ein Zimmer in dem Appartement hatte, welches er vermietet hatte. Allerdings kümmert er sich viel zu schwach um die Ausstattung seines Appartements und geht auf die Wünsche der Gäste nur mit Verzögerung ein. Als Beispiel dafür: wir hatten ein Zimmer für drei Personen, welches auch wirklich nur als Schlafraum dienen sollte, dass ansonsten keinen Raum da war, wäre nicht schlimm gewesen, da wir einen Schrank für unsere Kleidung im Flur bekommen, den dann allerdings andere Gäste bekommen haben, mit der Begründung ihr Zimmer sei kleiner als unseres. Der Unterschied war, das es ein 2-Bett-Zimmer war... Nach 5 Tagen hatten wir einen anderen Schrank bekommen. Dieser war einer für die man Kleiderbügel brauchte, die natürlich gefehlt haben... unverschämt ist daran, dass für gewöhnlich dir Gäste nicht länger als 3-4 Tage ein Zimmer mieten, der Host also mit Absicht keine neuen Möbel geholt hat. Das selbe gilt für den Kühlschrank. Der Ort hat Vor- und Nachteile. Es liegt mitten im Zentrum der la rambla. Absolut toll, auch der Strand ist nicht so weit weg, mit dem Bus ist man in 10 min da zu Fuß 45min. fand ich persönlich sehr angenehm, da man bei gutem Wetter viel spaziert ist. Abends ist es allerdings nicht so schön in dem gesamten Viertel Barrio Gotico, wo sich das Appartment befindet, wird man alle 10m von einem Dealer oder einer Prostituierten angesprochen, was auf Dauer echt nervt. Nachts verwandelt sich das Gebiet also zu einem Ghetto...dafür kann der Host jedoch nichts. Leider sind wir nicht wirklich fündig geworden, was gute Restaurants angeht...falls..."},{"_id":"286347567","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1530849600000"}},"listing_id":"10802909","reviewer_id":"79373458","reviewer_name":"Amina","comments":"Really central and super close to la rambas and other popular areas !"},{"_id":"289381206","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1531368000000"}},"listing_id":"10802909","reviewer_id":"182949384","reviewer_name":"Charlotte","comments":"Buen alojamiento"},{"_id":"296229127","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1532491200000"}},"listing_id":"10802909","reviewer_id":"182948981","reviewer_name":"George","comments":"Great location, right in the heart of Barcelona.

We had a bit of trouble checking-in, since we didn't have the apartment number in the information provided to us. That was not Tara's fault though.. When you come here, just make sure you get all of the neccessary info in advance from airbnb. The aparment was clean and well-kept and communication with Tara was easy and quick. She let us check out pretty late (3pm), which we really really appreciated! The only thing we didn't love about the place was that there sometimes was a bit of an odor coming out of the bathroom.. I'm pretty sure that isn't Tara's fault either though, it must be a problem with old plumbing.

Excellent idea to have an electronic lock so forgetting your key is never an issue. We were especially impressed with the size and openness of your living space, with windows on both sides.  This is a standout in HK apartments of this size, and the pictures didn't do it justice.  We were with four, a couple and two grown kids, which worked very well.    Having an apartment at this location allowed us to get fresh food in the wet markets just two blocks away and enjoy local food at home.  \nThis flat lets you do Hong Kong like a local.

Go up the escalator to access the Peak walk/run (the queue for the tourist cable car is pretty close too). Before 10am, take the escalator down the hill to be in the heart of Central (after 10am the escalator changes direction and runs up the hill). Hong Kong and Central MTR stations take you to anywhere you want. Another 5 minute walk and you're at the ferries. Tara's place was very comfortable for our family - 2 adults, 2 teenagers.

They provide mineral water, boiler, instant coffee tea, snacks, facial masks, sunscreens, lotion, umbrella, various sizes of towels etc in the room. The location was perfect as it's within walking distance to Harbour Plaza (less than 10 mins) where I attended a conference. Quarry bay station and bus stops to Causeway bay etc are very near too.

It is an older style building and apartment, an old touch of Hong Kong history and character.  I've added all my favourite artistic touches and light fixtures  to make it more modern and cosy. The place is white and grey with light wooden floors. This place is very large for hk around 1000 sqft! Its perfect for sharing and everyone can have their own room :) The large size reflects the character of its time, spaces were large back then and now modern HK apartments are very small and cramped.  **Please note: There is NO elevator. It's a walk up building to 4th floor.** The Bathroom set up is interesting, there are 2 rooms w toilets.  I have designat","neighborhood_overview":"Super location for tourists, you can walk to most places within minutes  5 min to Lan kwai fong  5 min to sheung wan Mtr 5 min to SOHO 5 min to Escalators 10 min to Central Mtr  15 min to IFC","notes":"**Please note: There is NO elevator. It's a walk up building to 4th floor.** *** They are doing some construction in the building's stairway right now, so it may be dusty and have some stuff like ladders in the hall. sorry about the inconvenience but don't worry if the apartment is perfectly fine and ready for your arrival :) *** In Hong Kong there is always construction going on. Its hard to avoid so you most likely will  hear  construction / street noise in the apartment during the day. The heater for shower needs to be turned on to heat up about 10 min before using, and please turn it off after :) Kitchen has the basics, such as stove burner, kettle, toaster, coffee maker, fridge, pots and pans, utensils and more. Please note we don't use a microwave, so there is no microwave.

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it. \n"},{"_id":"62187769","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1455253200000"}},"listing_id":"10840938","reviewer_id":"47448814","reviewer_name":"Sergio","comments":"The apartment itself is nicely decorated and in good condition, with two good sized bedrooms, one bedroom with a tatami and also a sofa bed.

If so, this place will be perfect for you! I’m talking no hot water, putrid stairwells, blocked sinks, dust-encrusted lamps, wardrobes that don’t open, tea towels for curtains so you will always wake before 6am, exposed wiring... the list goes on. As someone who has, until recently, lived in HK my whole life, I know how expensive rents are there, but (despite the apartment’s great location), it’s utterly outrageous to pay so much for so very little. \nOh, and to call it “huge” in the ad is a blatant lie. Hats off to whoever took the ridiculously misleading photos as well. The truth is that this is a small, scummy, dark, depressing abode with zero charm or character.

Just right next to famous Michillin recommended Kau Kee Restaurant, which I visited many times since I first visited HK at 2009. This area is closed to famous foodie paradise SOHO-area and famous HK bar area \"Lan Kwai Fong\". Also perfect choice for folks attending/visiting exhibition at WanChai expo. It is a bit hard to find for first time and I am giving your instruction here: E2 exit of ShengWan MTR station, you will see a square call \"Grand Millennium square/COSCO plaza\", walk up and cross the XING, you will find a well decorated stair, walk up the stair(or if you have heavy luggage and hard to carry up, you may keep walking up the hill and turn right on 7-11 store, then turn right again you will see the blue logo laudry shop), on you left is a blue logo laundry shop, the entrance just right next to it, so is the keys. 地处九记牛腩和地铁“上环站E2出口”之间,第一次来的人不会很好找,从E2出来经过中远COSCO广场往上走,过了人行红绿灯就有一个扶手装有LED装饰灯的楼梯,走上去(不要怀疑)左手边有一个蓝色招牌的洗衣店,旁边那个门就是了,钥匙在门口的密码锁里｡如果行李太多不方便走楼梯,就继续往斜坡上面走,7-11便利店右拐往上再走一段右拐的后巷里就能看到洗衣店招牌｡九记牛腩就在旁边一个路口｡这个位置确实很正中,三房一厅有厨房厨具齐全,不过我们没煮吃的｡建议想深度游览港岛的游客和去参加展会的人住｡我们是来展会的,早餐在E2出口往西30米的茶餐厅解决了就出发展会,每天如此｡距离兰桂坊也不远,散步的速度10分钟可到｡"},{"_id":"338571382","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1540008000000"}},"listing_id":"10840938","reviewer_id":"178746503","reviewer_name":"Joshua","comments":"Thank you for your place!

The neighborhood is also home to Barnard College, Grant's Tomb, Riverside Church, The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Morningside Park, and an assortment of great restaurants, cafes, diners, book shops, and stores and shops of every kind. Morningside Heights is simultaneously vibrant and low-key, an area that many say is one of the few remaining genuinely 'neighborly' neighborhoods in NYC - a great place to stay when visiting the city.","notes":"5% discount for stays of 1 week or more 10% discount for stays of 1 month or more 20% discount for stays of 3 months or more","transit":"The 1 train is just two blocks away and the 2/3 express trains are only 2 stops away; all of them quickly connect to Times Square where almost all the other subway lines stop too.

We stayed as a couple for just over a month and miss it already. Paul showed us around the neighbourhood when we first got there and was easily contactable thereafter.\r\n\r\nPaul's place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r\n\r\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping!

I didn't want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it's right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!

Paul, my host, hit it out of the park. The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn't your destination, Paul's apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia's campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul's building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn't dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul's apartment is decorated with an artist's eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home.

The kitchen is very well equipped for cooking as well as serving-dishes and glassware enough for our crowd. The little things were appreciated-enough hangers in the coat closet to stow our coats, dishwashing detergent under the sink, so we didn't have to buy that at the market. Really nice linens on the beds, plenty of towels, good lighting. Amazing main bathroom shower-we took pictures of it! \nGreat closet space, again with coat hangers. Off of the main bedroom, there is an away space-office type room. My husband used it to meditate, but it'd be great for any kind of quiet space. We didn't use the courtyard, but it would be so nice to utilize in milder weather. \nWe didn't see Miriam, but she was very good at communicating by email. \n"},{"_id":"127012410","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1484456400000"}},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"2914917","reviewer_name":"Mike","comments":"Great host and excellent communication."},{"_id":"128278077","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1485147600000"}},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"8054016","reviewer_name":"Frankiew","comments":"Very modern, clean, comfortable.

Many good Restaurants and Bars within 15mins by foot - nice and calm neighbourhood. \n\nThe flat is clean and well equiped.

Close to many subway lines, Miriam's apartment was perfectly located for popping into Manhattan as well as getting around Brooklyn in general.  \nCheck in was seamless, Miriam was the perfect balance of attentive and easy to get in touch with without feeling like you were being \"watched\".  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed and was very comfortable.

There are rules around times you can park, but we arrived on Friday afternoon and stayed until Tuesday with no problems at all. There are garages in the surrounding area that do have spots available for longer stays if needed. The apartment itself is clean and comfortable, although we did not spend much time there.

So grateful for this experience and will be staying there again!"},{"_id":"281218304","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1529812800000"}},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"28635080","reviewer_name":"Nick","comments":"Nice place in a great neighborhood that can fit a family easily"},{"_id":"286098115","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1530763200000"}},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"72535635","reviewer_name":"Sally","comments":"Our family of four with teens had a pleasant and comfortable 6 night stay at Miriam's.

The area is safe and convenient with plenty of options for getting into the city. The description is accurate. The apartment is atypical and the TV area is part of the cellar.

We were 7 and we had all the space, 2 bathrooms was a must and a large opened kitchen which was fully equipped to spend good breakfast, lunch or dinner time. We didn’t have the opportunity to relax in the garden but it was charming and we believe that it must be so cool to have BBQ or jus rest. We discovered the neighborhood, just turn the quiet street the home is and you’ll get in Brooklyn, a slice of New York in a more relaxed atmosphere and authentic architecture. Nice restaurants, subways to go anywhere, groceries with fresh foods, it’s all around the corner. Few minutes from the apartment you can go to Barclays center and see NBA Brooklyn Nets, have shopping in Fulton & Jays streets, Fort Greene park  is a nice place, only 4 stations to reach Brooklyn Bridge and its unique view of Manhattan with the C train which is only 3 minutes from the apartment at walking distance,  Thanks to Miriam we had a wonderful stay in New York Brooklyn."},{"_id":"345653265","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1541394000000"}},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"27491644","reviewer_name":"Lillian","comments":"Wonderful neighborhood and quick responses!"},{"_id":"347515043","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1541912400000"}},"listing_id":"10857454","reviewer_id":"200424940","reviewer_name":"Allison","comments":"Miriam is an amazing superhost!

Karen was helpful from the moment we asked to stay in her place, to even after we left as she returned something we forgot. Her place was extremely clean and cozy, and has a really friendly cat who only comes around every now and then. The bed was so comfortable .. lol. The area is perfect, you can literally go up one block and you're on a street with so many restaurants. (5 Napkin Burger is amazing. Otto's Tacos are perfect for a late night snack.) Central Park and Times Square were only about a 15-20 minute walk, and the surrounding streets were really quiet. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a short, comfortable, fun  and inexpensive NYC stay. Thank you for everything Karen, you're a great host.

With the caveat that many HK apartments are relatively small, Maria’s place was certainly big enough for a couple.  Two key things:  the bathroom had ample hot/cold water and the bed was super comfortable.  We didn’t cook anything, but the kitchen was well-stocked and there’s a small grocery store just next to the apartment. The location is great – two blocks from a metro station, near the trolley / bus lines, right below Man Mo Temple, and about a 15-20 minute walk to Central, Soho, and the piers.  There’s a great dim sum place about a block north and wonderful older streets, with traditional shops selling ginseng and dried seafood are all nearby.

There are tons of cute cafes, restaurants, and shops a stone throw’s away. Be aware though that Sheung wan is extremely hilly, with lots of stairs. The MTR station is very close — a straight walk down Hilier st, which is right in front of the apt. No hills or stairs on this walk! I should also say that cabs are very easy to find in front of the apt, and quite cheap and reliable. Cabbies often don’t speak English but we showed our destination on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, and this worked great every time. \n\nThe apt itself was small by our Wisconsin standards but probably quite large by HK standards. It was clean and cozy and perfectly fine. It was surprisingly quiet for being in such a bustling neighborhood. The bathroom and kitchen were small (but we didn’t need to cook or even shop for groceries considering all the amazing food options nearby) and there was little storage for our stuff. But for two people it was great and we had such a wonderful time there. Nothing but lovely memories. \n\nMaria missed our initial Airbnb request because she was traveling, but once we got a hold of her she was super responsive and helpful. \n\nWe had such a happy stay in HK.

It's in Flatbush, which if you are new to the city might not be the best neighborhood for beginners as it isn't close to many attractions (although Park Slope and Fort Greene are close), but the apartment and neighborhood were both clean and safe.

De modo geral a nossa experiência foi tranquila e agradável. A Karen e o Joshua foram bastante receptivos e atenciosos conosco, sempre nos perguntavam se estávamos bem,  se precisávamos de alguma coisa, se estávamos curtindo a cidade e etc. Eles dão total liberdade para entrada e saída do apartamento em qualquer horário e nos entregaram as chaves logo que chegamos. Sempre saíamos pela manhã e chegávamos de madrugada, circulávamos pelo corredor e utilizávamos o banheiro e nunca tivemos nenhum problema, mesmo porque tomávamos cuidado. O quarto é pequeno, a cama é muito boa, tínhamos travesseiros, cobertas e espaço no armário. A diferença entre as fotos que vemos no anúncio e o apartamento de modo geral é grande, pois existem muito mais móveis e objetos em vários lugares, mas o quarto é exatamente igual, quentinho e aconchegante. As crianças são lindas e comunicativas. Muito fofas!\r\nO bairro é muito legal também, tem mercadinhos, lojinhas de conveniências, farmácia e para os que arriscam, algumas opções para comer. Fica ao lado do metrô (2 and 5 trains), e quando eu digo ao lado, são apenas 3 minutos caminhando do apartamento e 30 minutos de Manhattan (Durante o dia. De madrugada é um pouco mais). Excelente localização! \r\nCom certeza repetiríamos a experiência! Esperamos voltar muito em breve e adoraríamos que eles nos recebessem. \r\n\r\nThank you, folks! You are really especial to us!

They received us warmly, gave us lots of advice and told us interesting stories about themselves. Also, they tried to keep it as quiet as possible in the mornings, which is surely a challenge with two energetic little kids.\r\nTheir apartment is really close to the subway (about a 2min-walk), which will easily take you to other parts of Brookly and Manhattan.\r\nThere are two things that you should be aware of, however: the neighborhood seemed a  little rough to us, so that you should be careful at night. Since the walk from the subway to the flat is so short, it only bothered us the first night, when we were a little surprised at the number of policemen and shady people on the streets. \r\nAlso, as it truthfully says in the description, the room is very small and a little problematic for two people with big luggage. It is not a place where you would want to hang out very much; which should not be a great issue either, if you know it in advance and plan to be out and about all day anyways.  \r\nThe whole apartment is rather small (it looks more spacious on the pictures), so that you have to feel comfortable with \"intruding\" on the family's much used living room, since the guest room is right next to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"_id":"20206693","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1411617600000"}},"listing_id":"1089542","reviewer_id":"21259077","reviewer_name":"Abdelrahman","comments":"Our experience at karen's place was good,they are very helpful and very good people.\nThe wifi was bad and this was an issue for us other than that nothing was bad at our stay"},{"_id":"20601252","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1412222400000"}},"listing_id":"1089542","reviewer_id":"18012711","reviewer_name":"Steffi","comments":"Karen and Joshua were very kind and caring hosts.

The room was very comfortable, and I thought it was plenty of space for one person with a few bags. The rest of the apartment is nice and comfy as well, and I appreciated that I was made to feel welcome to use the common areas when I was around. The apartment has only one bathroom but I never felt like there were any conflicts with getting time in the shower or anything. Location is fantastic--there's a subway station literally just round the corner and I found it very quick and easy to get into Manhattan every day. I honestly never felt all that uncomfortable with the neighborhood, as other reviews mentioned, but I guess that kind of thing is relative.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this, it really has to be said that this is just the nicest family. Karen and Joshua are so friendly and also really interesting people. I tend to be a little shy of strangers and sometimes find it stressful staying in a room in the home of a family I don't know, but Karen and Joshua never made me feel like I was intruding, and I had some really enjoyable conversations with them. Their two kids are also super cute and very precocious. \r\n\r\nI would absolutely recommend staying here, and would happily stay here again myself on any future visit to the area.

Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Karen in person as she was out of town during my stay but Joshua looked after my wellbeing, making sure I was fine, recommending restaurants and giving all the useful tips you might need when staying in New York! Their kids were just adorable and \"JJ\" the cat got loads of extra cuddles from me :-) Karen and Joshua's home is exactly as described: 40-45mins by Subway into Manhattan (Midtown: Times Square, Theatre District ...), their place being actually located right in the 'heart of Brooklyn' gave me sort of a suburban feeling with its own vibes and even tranquillity as I barely heard any street noise at all ... waking up to birds singing in the trees and someone playing a piano lovingly in the distance is quite unusual in a City like New York, so that was a real treat during my stay!!! The bed was extremely comfortable, I overslept not only once during my eight-day-stay with them and having the luxury of 'my very own little fridge' in my room was definitely another Highlight!!! Travelling to and from Manhattan by Subway is really easy and I always felt safe ... even late at night or at 4am in the morning hours walking home all by myself, no need to feel unsafe at all! The Subway Station is located right around the corner (3min walk from Karen and Joshua's home!) and has also elevators which comes in handy when you're carrying heavy luggage!

When we arrived, we were immediately welcomed by the friendly Greenberg family. They are respectful of space and privacy, and their children were very well behaved! \r\n\r\nOur room was very comfortable. We had an adjustable bed that would be transformed into a twin size if we needed more space. We were provided with a large closet and drawers to unpack in. We also had  a mini fridge, which was great for leftovers so that we could save money for meals.  \r\n\r\nThe location of the BNB was very close to the subway station which made it very easy to get around. We were also just a few steps away from city buses that could take you all over to different neighborhoods of Brooklyn! For cyclists, the Citi Bike Rentals are more concentrated in downtown Brooklyn which is a short subway ride away. Brooklyn has great cycling lanes that make you feel safe travelling on two wheels. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is culturally rich with a wide variety of sights, sounds and smells! If you love Caribbean food, you will have plenty of options to choose from!  \r\n\r\nThis BNB was an excellent opportunity to observe REAL life in New York. \r\n\r\n\r\n  "},{"_id":"54138095","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1447650000000"}},"listing_id":"1089542","reviewer_id":"46887444","reviewer_name":"Alea","comments":"I had a great time, Karen and Joshua were great host I even met their kids.

We arrived at their house at 10:30pm after a full day of traveling (it was at that point 4:30am where we woke up). When we arrived we buzzed and called both Karen and Josh and banged on the door, but it ended up being an hour before we heard back from them and were let in. Karen was at work which we knew, but it turns out Josh was inside sleeping and didn't hear our repetitive knocks or his phone going off.\n\nAfter we finally got settled everything was fine. Karen seems nice, didn't interact with Josh as much. The apartment is just a block from the 2 and 5 trains which go right into Manhattan in 20-30 minutes. Not a great neighborhood but we didn't plan on spending time there anyway. The apartment had everything we needed. The feature of the bed pulling out to a queen is nice and convenient, though there's not much more space in the room when it is out. There was a bit of just cosmetic mold in the shower.\n\nFor the price the stay was worth it.

It is located very close to a subway station and bus stop, with many pharmacies stores and shops around (try the local Nostrand Donut Shop for breakfast and donuts!).

You don't get to meet host often so I enjoyed my privacy. If there are no other Airbnb guests, you can enjoy the whole place with a fancy kitchen and washroom. Just to keep you company there will be a cat always in the living room. \nThe only issue I had was the parking. You will find a spot 4 blocks away after spending an hour during busy hours. I'll recommend not to keep a car but that is the problem with all of the Brooklyn.  My favorite thing was the area around.

It was a lot of fun to play with origami together the last night.\nRoom was simple, but there was refrigerator, too and was very easy to spend.\nThe house was only one block away from the subway and there was nothing to worry about in security.Overall it is a recommended property!"},{"_id":"329288998","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1538107200000"}},"listing_id":"1089542","reviewer_id":"19168135","reviewer_name":"Clifton","comments":"Great place to stay at in Brooklyn.

They are warm-hearted, welcoming people and super easy to communicate with. They even invited me to a private holiday celebration which was so kind and a super cool experience. The two kids are lovely and very friendly and fun. \nThe location is very close to the subway which makes it easy to get to Manhattan. Sometimes it can be a bit annoying because of track maintenance etc. but that’s something you accept by deciding to stay outside of Manhattan. I didn’t particularly like the neighborhood and didn’t feel very comfortable coming home late as a girl by myself. But that’s just a feeling, nothing ever happened and there were always other people in the street.\nI want to thank Karen and Joshua again for the nice time I enjoyed at their home."},{"_id":"342334989","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1540699200000"}},"listing_id":"1089542","reviewer_id":"210523660","reviewer_name":"Richard","comments":"Very pleasant family.

They pretend to like you sufficiently. But truly they don't like you. They want you just to take a sleep and showers in their house. \nDon't believe the notice paper which they gave you. Sometimes they will have discussion about garbage which you threw into trash box. They will hate you to cook in their kitchen. They should not respect cultural diffrence. They will disgust with you into their mind.\nPlease avoid this weird family if you will be traveller in long times or not. It's never cozy and private place to you. They will bother you who stays in their home. \nFor avoiding this family, I got out here in this winter with my heavy luggages...I think that they just want a money without love to other people. \nThank you for karen, joshua for all you've done in your house. \nI experienced weird and isolated in room and the worst remembrance in NYC.

From the moment I arrived, I was welcomed into their home and family. Everything was exactly as expected with great amenities - the washer and dryer are especially helpful for longer stays. The room is a little small, but since this is New York, that's to be expected (and hopefully you aren't spending too much time in your room anyway). It should be mentioned you'll be living with Karen and Joshua's family; if you are someone who just wants a quiet place where you don't have to talk to anyone else, this might not be the home for you. If however, you enjoy interacting with others and having interesting conversations then this is the place for you. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and I give Karen and Joshua's place a hearty recommendation!"}]}
